Press pastry into a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Cover with two layers of aluminum foil, then add pie weights or dried beans.
Slice heirloom and Roma tomatoes into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Remove seeds with your fingers and discard. Transfer six heirloom slices to a paper towel-lined plate; cover with more paper towels and set aside for decorating the pie. Arrange remaining heirloom slices and all Roma slices on a wire rack.

Of course there are many other kinds of sushi rolls. Get ideas for fillings by looking at the ingredients listed on a menu from a sushi restaurant. Also, try the fillings in different combinations. We mixed and matched, and almost any combination of fillings seemed to work. One person did not like the nori, so we left the nori out of a roll for her. If you do this, be sure to use enough rice and pack it tightly while rolling or it will fall apart.
To make Boston rolls, follow the California rolls instructions, substituting shrimp for crabmeat. To make lobster rolls, follow the California rolls instructions, substituting lobster for crabmeat.
Options: sprinkle sesame seeds on rice or add a light smear of wasabi before rolling. Substitute mango for avocado.

Place the wide end of the sausage stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the inside of the casing to remove excess salt.
Cut the meat and fat into 1/2-inch wide chunks. Pass them once through the coarse blade of a meat grinder. In a large bowl, mix together the ground pork and fat with the garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne, thyme, paprika, bay leaf, sage, and hickory smoke. A wooden spoon works well.
Cut the casing into 26 inch lengths and tie a small knot in one end of each. Fit the open end over the tip of the sausage stuffer and slide it on until the tip of the stuffer touches the knot.

Heat avocado oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry onion in the hot oil until it is a deep brown, about 5 minutes. Strain browned onion into a small bowl using a slotted spoon, and set aside to use later.
Peel kiwi, cut into quarters, and set aside in a small bowl for later.
Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat, and toast gram flour until lightly browned and nutty, 2 to 4 minutes; transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Dry-roast poppy seeds in the same skillet until lightly brown and aromatic, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove to a small bowl; set aside.
In the same skillet, dry-roast nutmeg, mace, star anise, and Kashmiri chilies together until fragrant, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the whole spices and chilies to a spice grinder, and grind them to a coarse powder.
Add browned onions, kiwi, ginger paste, garlic paste, and serrano chile to the bowl of a food processor, and grind to a paste, about 30 seconds. Pour in mustard oil, white vinegar, and yogurt and pulse the food processor until everything is well blended, about 15 seconds.
Last of all, add roasted poppy seeds, roasted gram flour, roasted ground whole spices, chili powder, cumin, garam masala, black pepper, and salt to the food processor; process marinade for 1 minute.
Spoon marinade into a resealable plastic bag and add tenderized beef strips. Seal bag and squeeze gently to coat beef on all sides with marinade. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but ideally overnight.
Remove marinated beef from the refrigerator; thread beef strips on sturdy metal skewers, packing them in tightly. Reserve any leftover marinade to baste the kababs with as they cook. This prevents them from drying out.
Preheat an outdoor grill to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate.
Grill kababs on the preheated grill, uncovered, for 5 minutes per side.
Reduce grill temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), cover the grill, and cook kababs for 10 minutes. Turn kebabs, brush with marinade, and continue cooking until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 170 degrees F (77 degrees C), about 10 minutes more. If kababs look a bit dry at any point in the cooking process, brush both sides with a little bit of avocado oil.
Remove skewers to a serving dish. Discard any uncooked marinade. Enjoy the kababs with naan, sliced red onions, tamarind chutney, and green chutney.
For best results, mustard oil should be used, either by itself or mixed in a 1:1 ratio with another high smoke point oil like avocado, canola, or sunflower. I use a brand called Yandilla Mustard Seed Oil, available on Amazon.
The main thing in this recipe is the quality of the meat. The better the beef, the more tender your bihari kababs will be.

Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches, then tip the bowl to drain water. Repeat this process until water runs clear, about 7 rinses.

Pour vegetable oil and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water into the well. Stir to form a shaggy dough that just pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Use a little flour to clean the dough off the spoon.
Transfer dough to a work surface; press and knead for a few minutes until you have a smooth, soft dough. You can add a little more flour if it's too sticky but don't add too much. Form dough into a ball and wrap in plastic. Leave on the counter for 1 hour or pop it into the refrigerator for 3 hours to overnight.
Prepare buttered onions: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let mixture cool a bit, then transfer to a bowl and reserve until needed.
Prepare filling: Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well and mash until smooth. Let cool to room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place farmer's cheese in a bowl and break it up with a spoon. Add salt, pepper, and cayenne, then add 2 to 3 heaping spoons of the buttered onions. Be sure to drain off most of the butter so you're adding mostly onions. Mix just until ingredients are evenly combined.
Add cooled mashed potatoes and mix until thoroughly combined. Set aside while you roll the dough.
Roll ¼ of the dough at a time on a floured surface until very thin, at least 1/8-inch thick or thinner if possible. Cut 3 ½-inch circles out of the dough, saving all scraps for re-rolling.
Add about 2 tablespoons filling to the center of each circle. Moisten your fingertips with water and wet the edges, then fold the dough over the filling and seal the two edges together in the center. Flatten the filling very lightly under the dough as you press and seal the edge of each pierogi with your fingers, working from the center to the ends. Try not to trap air in the pierogi as you seal. The edge can be left as is, or you can pinch the dough every inch or so to make pleats for a more decorative appearance.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pierogi in batches and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes (they may or may not float to the top.)
While the pierogi are boiling, melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Transfer pierogi from the boiling water directly into the melted butter. Cook until light golden brown, about 2 minutes per side or longer if more browning is desired.
Continue boiling and browning pierogi in batches as needed.
Transfer to a plate and spoon buttered onions over top. Garnish with sour cream and chives.
The dough can be used right away, but it's best to let it rest at least 1 hour at room temperature.

If you can't find farmer's cheese, a firm, tangy cream cheese with a handful of extra-sharp white Cheddar will get you pretty close.

Pour in enough water to cover quinces and boil, with the pan partly covered, until fruit is soft, about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the bag of peels and pass quince flesh through a sieve or food mill. (For best results, don't use a food processor as it will result in too fine a texture.) You should have about 2 ½ pounds of fruit pulp.
Transfer quince pulp to a saucepan and add sugar. Ideally, you should add the same amount of sugar, by weight, as fruit pulp. Cook and stir over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking, frequently stirring with a wooden spoon, until paste becomes very thick and has a deep orange color, about 1 ½ hours. Draw the wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan: it should leave a trail, and quince mixture will stick to the spoon.
