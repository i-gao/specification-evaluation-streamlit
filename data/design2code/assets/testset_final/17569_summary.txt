Create a blog layout with a black header area containing the blog title in bold white font on the left and a subtitle in smaller, lighter gray font below it. Below the header, center a white content area with black text for the blog post title in bold, followed by the date in smaller gray text, then the main post text in dark gray. Include four centered blue images (source: 'rick.jpg') spaced evenly down the blog content, each with a small, centered caption in light gray beneath. Red hyperlink text appears within paragraphs. The page background is light gray, and the bottom contains a small visitor count on the left, and centered red and gray footer text with hyperlinks. The overall font is clean and readable, with ample white space margin around the content area.
