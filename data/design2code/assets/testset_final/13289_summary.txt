Create a webpage layout with a black vertical sidebar on the left containing two groups of white text links stacked vertically with subtle spacing: the top group has four links and the bottom group has three links. The main content area to the right includes a dark charcoal header section with a large faint heading and a smaller grey subheading below it. Below the header is a wide light gray content area centered horizontally, containing headings in large serif font with date and location details in smaller uppercase serif font beneath. Include paragraphs of body text in a clean sans serif font, with some underlined blue hyperlinks. Insert empty rectangular image placeholders outlined in thin black lines in the content area. At the bottom of the page, create a dark charcoal footer with small white text on the left side, including a bold website name and a tagline, and below that a row of small blue links spaced evenly. The overall font palette uses serif fonts for headings and uppercase details and sans serif for paragraphs, with a monochromatic color scheme anchored by black, dark charcoal, light gray, white, and blue link highlights.
