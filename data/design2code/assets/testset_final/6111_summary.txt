The layout features a top navigation area with a blue rectangular image on the left and four equally sized dark teal squares on the right, each containing white text. Below the image are two green buttons aligned horizontally. Underneath is a wide dark gray horizontal bar with three white tabs on the left and a white search input field with a small green button on the right. The main content uses a breadcrumb-style navigation with small dark teal tags and a bold heading. Below are text sections in black on white background, followed by two rows of large light gray rectangular buttons with dark teal text inside, arranged side by side. A green rectangular button is placed under these. The footer area is light gray with two columns: the left column contains text links in blue, including a dropdown for language selection with a small blue square icon, and the right column displays three blue rectangular images of varying sizes below a bold heading, with a row of small icons below labeled "Connect." The very bottom is a dark gray bar with white text for legal and navigational links aligned left and right. The font throughout is clean and sans-serif.
