Create a webpage with a light gray background and a centered white content area. At the top, place a large blue image spanning the width of the content area using the source 'rick.jpg'. Below it, add a horizontal navigation bar with four equally spaced buttons in a subtle gray gradient, each labeled and aligned center. Underneath, include a bold black headline followed by a date on the left. Next, insert a medium-sized blue image (rick.jpg) aligned to the left with surrounding text paragraphs using a clean serif font in black. Further down, add another blue image (rick.jpg) smaller in size, centered with a light blue hyperlink beneath it aligned center. Beneath that, place a small blue image (rick.jpg) centered, followed by a left-aligned 'Tweet' text. Finally, add a row of three small gradient gray buttons labeled "Send," "Print," and "Save" centered at the bottom.
