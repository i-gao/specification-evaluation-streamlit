Create a clean, two-column blog layout with a white background. At the top-left, place a solid bright blue square image (src: 'rick.jpg') next to bold black text in a large sans-serif font for the blog title. Below that, add a horizontal black navigation bar with white uppercase menu items aligned left and a right-aligned search box with a narrow orange submit button. The main area uses a left column that is wide and a narrower right sidebar separated by spacing. The main column has a bold black headline with a thick black horizontal line beneath it, followed by a large light gray content block containing bold headline text, smaller date text, paragraph in black, and a dark gray "Read more" button aligned bottom right. The right sidebar features multiple sections with bold black section titles underlined by a thin orange line, and below each title, black text links separated by light horizontal lines. Near the top of the sidebar, place a bright blue rectangle image (src: 'rick.jpg') above two small labels horizontally aligned beneath it. The footer is a dark, almost black horizontal bar occupying full width with small, light gray text right-aligned. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout with consistent spacing and black and orange accent colors.
