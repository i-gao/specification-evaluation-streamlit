Create a centered black background webpage with a bold blue rectangular image at the top center (src set to 'rick.jpg'). Below the image, place a white, centered, small font question text. Underneath the question, display two horizontally aligned orange rectangular buttons with slightly rounded corners, labeled "YES" and "NO" in white, bold text. Maintain balanced spacing among the image, text, and buttons for a clean, focused user prompt.
