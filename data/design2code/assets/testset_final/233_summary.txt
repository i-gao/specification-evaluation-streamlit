Create a webpage with a dark teal horizontal top banner containing a small blue square image on the left, followed by a centered white text line and an orange rectangular "LEARN MORE" button on the right side of the banner. Below that, place a white horizontal navigation bar with four bold dark teal links spaced evenly: TRY AKKA, DOCUMENTATION, BLOG, GET INVOLVED. Underneath, add a wide teal section with bold white text "News & Articles" aligned left. The main content area below has a light gray-blue background with a white rectangular card centered, casting a subtle shadow. Inside the card on the left, place a small orange date box with white date text, and next to it a bold dark teal heading and paragraphs and bullet points in black, with some text bolded or italicized. Below the card, display multiple blocks of text in bold dark teal headings with smaller orange date and link text beneath, left-aligned in a vertical list. At the bottom, add a footer with the same dark teal background containing three columns of white links and text aligned left, and a bright blue square image on the right side. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
