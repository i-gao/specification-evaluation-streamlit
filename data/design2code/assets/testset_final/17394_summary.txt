Create a dark-themed blog layout with a black header bar spanning the top containing the blog title in large white serif font on the left and a small right-aligned search link in beige. Below the header, use a dark gray background for the main content area. On the left, have a narrow vertical column with beige "Share" text and a "Labels" section below with beige links in a small sans-serif font. The main content area on the right contains the blog post date in small gray text, the post title in medium white serif font with an underline, followed by ingredients and instructions text in small white serif font with bullet points and numbered lists. Below the post, include a small beige share link and labels again. Then show sections titled COMMENTS and POPULAR POSTS in uppercase small gray sans-serif font. The popular posts area includes two dark gray rectangular blocks with post dates in small gray font, post titles in white serif, and share and comment links in beige. Finally, at the bottom center of the page, add small gray text with "Powered by Blogger" and "Alicia Mey." The entire layout uses a consistent serif font for headings and main text, and sans-serif for labels and minor text in beige and gray on dark backgrounds.
