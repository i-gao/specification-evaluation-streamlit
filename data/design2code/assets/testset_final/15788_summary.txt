Create a centered square webpage with a medium periwinkle blue background (#6E7BFF). Inside, place a deep sky blue (#0000FF) rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg') with a thin white border horizontally centered near the top. Above this image, align four small charcoal gray (#333333) square buttons horizontally across the left side underneath a top-right aligned black text navigation menu with four labeled links separated by vertical black lines. Below the image, add a light gray (#DDDDDD) wide rectangular area with centered dark gray (#333333) bold heading text. Underneath the heading, place a thin horizontal line and three lines of smaller descriptive text in a regular font and medium gray color, all center aligned. Finally, center a faint trademark or footer line in very light gray text below the box. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout, with subtle drop shadows on the main container for depth.
