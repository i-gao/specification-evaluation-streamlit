Create a centered, single-column blog layout with a clean white background. Place a wide, rectangular image at the top (src="rick.jpg") in bright royal blue that spans the content width but is not full screen wide. Below the image, include a small, centered caption with a mix of black and small cyan hyperlinks in a subtle serif font. Use a large, bold, black serif font for the main headline, left-aligned below the caption. Underneath, add a date in small, light brown italic serif text aligned left. Then, present the main content in paragraphs with a dark gray serif font, left-aligned, with distinct line spacing for readability. Include a second wide rectangular image in bright royal blue (src="rick.jpg") somewhere within the content area, aligned left with the text continuing below it. Near the bottom, add a horizontal footer with three evenly spaced small cyan links and subtle square icon placeholders on either side. Finally, add a single centered cyan link below the footer to serve as an archive link. The overall style is minimalist and elegant with a strong focus on readability and balanced whitespace.
