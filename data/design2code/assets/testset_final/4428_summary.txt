Create a blog page layout with a light gray background and a centered white content area. At the top left, place the blog title in bold, dark gray font with a smaller subtitle below in a lighter gray. Below that, include a blog post section with a bold dark gray headline and the date in smaller gray font. The post content text should be medium gray with some hyperlinks in light yellow-green. Include bold subheadings within the text in a darker gray. Embed a large blue rectangular image ("rick.jpg") centered below the first paragraph, with a small caption underneath in gray. Below the post, display two rounded rectangular tags with a very light yellow background and light green text. Add a dotted horizontal divider below the post area. Below that, present a "Popular posts" section with each post preview containing a small blue square image on the left, a bold dark gray title and italic green date above a short excerpt in medium gray text on the right, with a small green "READ MORE" link aligned bottom-right. Separate each popular post with a dotted horizontal divider. Use clean, sans-serif fonts and maintain consistent margins and spacing throughout.
