Create a clean, minimal webpage with a white background. Center the title "BALTIC" at the top in a large serif font, dark brown color. Below the title, create a horizontal navigation menu with three evenly spaced text links in uppercase, light beige color: "WEB MENU," "MASTER LIST," and "MANIFEST." Under the menu, display a tabular data section with black monospaced font showing column headers in bold. Below the table, place a medium-sized bright blue rectangular image aligned to the left. Beneath the image, add a small caption in dark brown, bold serif font. Finally, include a small italicized credit line at the bottom in dark brown serif font, centered horizontally.
