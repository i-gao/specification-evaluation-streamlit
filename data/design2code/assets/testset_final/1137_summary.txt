Create a webpage layout with a wide, dark blue header containing a large blue square image on the left and white bold headline text with some smaller white and yellow text to the right. Below the header, include a teal horizontal navigation bar with six small blue square icons spaced evenly, each accompanied by white bold text beneath them. Under that, place a narrower, darker blue bar with centered white bold text spanning two lines. Below this bar, the main content area features a large blue square image floated left with multiple paragraphs of black text on the right and continuing underneath. At the bottom of the content area, create a gold-colored box spanning the width with a blue square image on the left and black text on the right. Adjacent to that text, align four small blue square icons horizontally. Underneath the gold box, place a dark blue footer bar with five evenly spaced navigation labels in white bold text. Finally, a narrow white footer below includes icons and small blue text on the left and right sides. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
