Create a webpage with a top navigation bar aligned to the right containing four text links in uppercase dark gray font: "ABOUT," "ARCHITECTS," "FAQ," and a bordered button "GET MY FLOORPLAN" with rounded corners. Below, place a white content section with an image on the left (source 'rick.jpg') sized about 230x150 with rounded corners in a bright blue background area, and on the right side, text content with a bold, dark gray heading, followed by paragraph text in dark gray, and a small italicized, lighter gray subheading. Below the content is a thin horizontal divider line, with two small bordered buttons labeled "PREVIOUS" and "NEXT" on the right side in uppercase, dark gray font. The footer has two distinct sections: the upper part is bright blue with white text on the left reading "Get your own interactive floorplan:" and a white-outlined button on the right with white text labeled "GET MY FLOORPLAN." The bottom footer is a dark slate blue background with light gray text; the left side has "FIND US ON" above two social media links in white, spaced horizontally; the right side displays a questions/comments prompt in small text and an email reference in bold. Use clean, professional fonts consistent with the button text style and maintain ample white space for clarity.
