Create a webpage with a white background and a top header containing a small blue rectangular image aligned left, and three green text navigation links aligned right ("HOME," "ABOUT US," and "CONTACT US"). Below the header is a full-width purple navigation bar with a dropdown menu labeled "NEWS AND EVENTS" on the left and a search box with a small blue icon on the right. The main content area is divided into a left text section and a right sidebar. The left side includes black headings and paragraphs in a classic serif font, with a light purple box containing summary details and a blue link, placed right of center. The right sidebar features four horizontally aligned light green rectangular buttons with blue text. Below the main content are three small horizontally spaced blue square icons. At the bottom, separated by a thin horizontal line, the footer includes a small blue rectangular image in the center, text in blue on the left, and a larger translucent blue rectangle on the right with small grey text underneath. The overall layout uses traditional serif fonts for content and simple sans-serif for navigation links.
