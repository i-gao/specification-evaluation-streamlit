Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background. Place a small, outlined rectangular button with uppercase bold text in the top right corner labeled "Enter Using Password â†’." Centered below this button, have a bold black heading in a sans-serif font reading "Radio Futura Music," followed by a slightly smaller bold subheading in uppercase. Below that, include smaller regular text with a brief message, then a bold paragraph encouraging users to get notified. Under that is a horizontal email input field with light gray border and placeholder text "Email address," accompanied by a dark gray rectangular button labeled "Notify Me" with white uppercase bold text to the right. Further below, center a smaller bold heading reading "Spread the word," followed by three small white rectangular share buttons labeled "Share," "Tweet," and "Pin It" in uppercase bold black text, spaced evenly horizontally. At the very bottom center, place subtle small text reading "Powered by Shopify." The overall style is simple and monochrome with black and gray text on white background, no images.
