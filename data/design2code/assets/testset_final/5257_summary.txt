Create a clean, minimalistic webpage with a white background. At the top left, place a small blue breadcrumb navigation in a bold sans-serif font. Below, include a large, bold header in a dark gray, modern sans-serif font for the main title. Underneath, add two short paragraphs in a smaller, regular black font with ample spacing. Then list three blue hyperlinks in a bold style, each followed by a short explanation in regular black text. Further down, add a section heading in bold black followed by subheadings and smaller black text in a bullet point list format. The overall layout is left-aligned with plenty of white space and uses consistent dark blue for links and black/gray for text.
