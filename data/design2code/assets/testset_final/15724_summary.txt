Create a clean white webpage header with a small bright blue square image aligned in the top-left corner with the source set to 'rick.jpg'. To the right, place two columns of simple gray text links: the left column containing three links stacked vertically, and the right column containing three links aligned vertically as well. Below the header on the left, include a bold and underlined heading in black with a moderate font size. Centered vertically in the page, place a large bold and underlined black heading with the word "Art," using a significantly larger font size than the left heading. The overall layout is minimal with black text on white background and a bright blue image anchor in the top-left corner.
