Create a webpage with a full-width dark blue top header containing right-aligned white navigation links in a clean, sans-serif font. Below that, a white section features a left-aligned bright blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg'), to the right of which are four small circular buttons with blue square icons inside, aligned horizontally, followed by a search input on the far right. Below, a full-width horizontal orange navigation bar with white, bold, spaced text links centered. The main content area is white with large, gray headline text and body text in a simple, readable font with some orange highlight links. The footer is a full-width dark gray bar with centered white text and a blue hyperlink beneath it, all in a smaller font size with a clean sans-serif style. Keep the layout clean with ample white space and consistent alignment.
