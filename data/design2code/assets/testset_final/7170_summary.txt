Create a clean login page with a light gray background. Center a white rectangular login box with subtle shadow and rounded corners on the page. Above the login box, position a small bright blue rectangle image with src set to 'rick.jpg'. Inside the white box, place a centered heading at the top. Below the heading, arrange two labeled input fields horizontally aligned for username and password. Add a checkbox labeled "Remember me for 2 weeks" beneath the password field, aligned left. Below the checkbox, add a dark gray rectangular "Log In" button with white text, centered horizontally. Finally, under the button, include a small text link aligned left with some padding, stating "I forgot my password." Use a simple, clean sans-serif font throughout.
