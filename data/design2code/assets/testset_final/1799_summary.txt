Create a webpage with a dark header containing a left-aligned small grey text line and a right-aligned white search input box with a light blue search button. Below that, a black navigation bar with white uppercase menu items, with one item underlined in white. The main banner is a teal horizontal section with right-aligned small light grey links and a large white page title aligned left, followed by faint breadcrumb links in shades of grey and teal. The main content area has a light grey background with a white content box on the left containing a bold grey heading, lighter subheading, code snippet text, and a light blue rectangular "DOWNLOAD" button. Below that on the left is a smaller light blue rectangular "BACK" button, followed by a row of three small bright blue square icons labeled "Share" in teal text. On the right column are multiple stacked elements: a white box with a bold grey heading and bright blue inline "Share" label next to three small bright blue squares, a white box with grey bold uppercase text, a white box with a teal heading and light blue links, a teal box containing a white search field and grey "SEARCH DIRECTORY" button, and a larger teal box with a bright blue square image, bold grey uppercase subheading, and a white box featuring teal text links with bold light blue numeric labels. The footer is black with three columns of small uppercase grey headings, small teal links underneath them, and a small right-aligned teal "CONTACT" link above a white copyright line and "Privacy Policy" text at the bottom. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout.
