Create a clean webpage with a light blue horizontal header bar at the top. On the left side, include the site name in a serif font inside a pale blue rectangular background, and on the right side, add a simple navigation menu with small icons next to each link (Classes, Teach, Blog, Books) in a minimalist font aligned horizontally. The "Sign in" link should be placed in the top right corner in small text. Below the header, center a bold, dark gray heading with a large font size. Under that heading, stack two large horizontal images (with src set to 'rick.jpg') each filling most of the content width with some space between them. Below the images, add a small line of text with a subtle serif font and a blue hyperlink. Then include multiple paragraphs of left-aligned body text in a clean serif font with normal weight and black color. Some phrases in the text should be bold, italic, or include blue hyperlink styling. At the bottom, add a wide light gray footer area with four columns of text in a smaller serif font. Each column includes bold headings and blue hyperlinks for certain items. The overall layout should be spacious with ample white space and a neat, professional appearance.
