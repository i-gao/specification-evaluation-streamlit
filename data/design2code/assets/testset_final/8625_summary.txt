Create a clean, professional webpage with a white background. At the top, include a horizontal navigation bar with black text links: "Home," "Worldwide Coverage," "Bluetooth Tracking," and "Video Surveillance," spaced evenly on a light grey horizontal strip. Below, center a bold, black heading "Worldwide Coverage" with a smaller, grey subheading underneath. Under the text, place a large, vivid blue rectangular image (src set to 'rick.jpg') that spans nearly full width. Beneath the image, display three white, rounded-corner info cards stacked vertically with subtle drop shadows; each card has a small black bold title centered at top and smaller grey paragraph text below, all constrained in width and with ample padding. The page footer is dark charcoal with small grey text left-aligned, containing multiple columns of contact information in bold headings, addresses, and contact details, along with social media buttons on the right side for Twitter and LinkedIn in subtle black and grey. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout.
