Create a webpage with a light beige background and a top dark gray horizontal bar containing a small blue image on the left and a right-aligned horizontal navigation menu with white text links reading "Events," "Forum," "Blogs," and "Images." Below that, add a wide black rectangular header bar with large white bold text. Underneath, place a row of four small rectangular buttons with light beige backgrounds and dark gray borders, where the second button is dark gray with white text. On the left side below this, stack two blue rectangular images vertically with some spacing. On the right side, include a white content area with a tabbed navigation bar containing two tabs—one white and the other light gray—and below that a large beige box with bold dark gray heading text and smaller gray breadcrumb links beneath. Inside the white content area, position a smaller blue square image aligned left, with small blue hyperlinked text below it and black paragraph text to the right. Below that, center a large blue wide rectangle image and further under, a bulleted list with some bold and blue hyperlinked text. At the bottom, place a small blue square on the left with a numeric link next to it and faint gray footer text below. The entire page ends with a dark gray footer containing small white text centered and aligned that includes a copyright notice and site credits. Use clean sans-serif fonts and ensure consistent padding and spacing throughout.
