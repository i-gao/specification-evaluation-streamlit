Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background. At the top left, place the site title "MUSSOLA" in bold black text with a smaller italicized gray subtitle below it. Align a dark blue "CERCA" search link to the top right. Below the title on the left, add a horizontal navigation bar with three bold dark blue links spaced evenly: "Cerca de feina," "Biblioteca," and "Contacte." Center a black text message in the main content area indicating a page not found error. Finally, place a small dark blue footer text centered at the bottom reading "Amb la tecnologia de Blogger." Use a simple serif font for content and a sans-serif bold font for navigation links and footer text.
