Create a clean web layout centered on the page with left-aligned text. Include a vertical light blue line to the left of the main paragraph text as a border highlight. The text should be in a standard sans-serif font, with blue-colored hyperlinks interspersed inline naturally. The page background is white and the text color is a dark gray for readability. There are no images in this layout. The overall style is minimal and professional with a focus on content clarity.
