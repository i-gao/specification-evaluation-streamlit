Create a full-screen black background section with content aligned to the right side. Use white, uppercase, spaced-out sans-serif font for the main heading, arranged in multiple centered lines. Below the heading, include a thin, short horizontal line in a muted gold tone. Under that, add a smaller, lowercase, spaced-out white text line, followed by a rectangular gold-toned button labeled with uppercase white text centered inside. The overall style is minimalist, modern, and elegant with a focus on clean typography and strong contrast.
