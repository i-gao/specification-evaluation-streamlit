Create a webpage with a light green background and a central beige content box. At the top, place a large blue rectangular image with the source 'rick.jpg'. Below the image, center a header with "atha yoga nusasanam" in white and yellow bold fonts, followed by a smaller light gray tagline underneath. Below that, add a narrow beige navigation bar containing right-aligned white bold links. The main content area includes a centered title in dark gray bold serif font, a subtitle, and input fields for selecting a "Pada" chapter and a sutra verse with a "View" button. Underneath, render multiple sections of text with source attribution in small, light gray font and the main body text in a medium gray serif font. Emphasize certain headings with blue bold text. At the bottom of the page, include a small light gray footer with centered text and a final line with three small, bold navigation links separated by vertical bars in white on green background. Use consistent serif fonts for content and sans-serif for navigation, maintaining clean spacing and alignment.
