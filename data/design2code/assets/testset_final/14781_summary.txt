Create a centered webpage with a light gray background. At the top, place a large, bold dark gray header with the site title. Below that, include a wide dark gray horizontal bar containing light text aligned left and a bright blue clickable link on the right. Underneath, center a white card with subtle drop shadow containing a bold dark gray heading aligned left, a smaller date text below it, and a text block to the right of a small, bright blue rectangular image on the left side inside the card. At the bottom of the card, add a bright blue clickable link on the left and a bolder bright blue clickable link on the right. Below the card, add a centered bright blue clickable "More posts" link. Finally, near the bottom center, place a smaller bright blue clickable "Powered by Blogger" link, a small muted gray copyright text, and a small muted gray "Report Abuse" text below. Use clean, modern sans-serif fonts throughout.
