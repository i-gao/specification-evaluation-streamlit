Please create a webpage layout with a black top navigation bar containing six evenly spaced small blue square icons. Below the navbar, on the left side, place a large square blue image (rick.jpg) and beneath it, a legend with two small blue square icons and corresponding text labels. On the right side, aligned at the top, add a green text call-to-action line and below it, aligned right, a gray "Helpful Links" heading. The main content area should be a vertically long white background with text content aligned left in black and dark green fonts, structured in headings and paragraphs. At the bottom right corner, include a small blue square icon followed by a green "Back to Top" link. The blue squares representing icons and images should match the same distinct blue color. Use clean and readable sans-serif fonts throughout.
