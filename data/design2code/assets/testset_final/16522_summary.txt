Create a clean and simple webpage layout with a narrow red top banner containing centered white text for a first-time guest offer. Below that, include a black navigation bar with horizontally aligned white menu items spaced evenly: Home, Menu, Client Registration, and Appointments. Centered beneath is a large italic red heading with horizontal red lines extending left and right. Under this heading, place three columns of smaller gray text blocks evenly spaced horizontally. Below that section, add two columns with black subheadings in a modern sans-serif font and supporting text in gray with some underlined links in green and blue. Use a light gray background footer with centered small gray text lines and a thin subtle horizontal divider line above the bottom text. The overall style is minimal, with a focus on legibility and spacing, using red for emphasis and black and gray for content text, on a white background.
