Create a web page with a dark blue header background spanning the full width. Place a small bright blue rectangular logo on the far left in the header. On the far right side of the header, place two links in white text horizontally aligned. Below the header, add a white text headline left-aligned on the dark blue background. Below the headline, place a wide, rounded-corner search input with medium opacity dark blue background and white placeholder text, horizontally centered but aligned overall with the headline margin. The page background below the header should be white with a center-aligned message in small black text. Near the bottom center of the page, place one medium bright blue rectangle with three smaller bright blue square dots evenly spaced below it. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
