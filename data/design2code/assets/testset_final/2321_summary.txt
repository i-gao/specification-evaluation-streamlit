Create a centered content box with a thin, dotted black border on a white background. Inside the box, position a block of text on the left with a clear hierarchy: a large title in a clean sans-serif font at the top, followed by smaller, lighter author text beneath it. Below that, include a paragraph of description text, then bold subheadings for "Ingredients," "Instructions," and "Notes" sections, with relevant bullet points and numbered steps. On the right side of the box, place a medium-sized rectangular image filled with solid bright blue color that serves as a placeholder for an image. At the bottom center of the box, add a small footer line of text with a credit link styled in a smaller font size. The overall layout should maintain balanced spacing with the text taking up roughly two-thirds of the width and the blue image the remaining third.
