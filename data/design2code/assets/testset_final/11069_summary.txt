Create a clean, minimal blog layout with a white background. At the top center, display the blog title in a serif font in dark brown (#4A3B22) with all uppercase letters. On the top right, place a small "SEARCH" link in a golden brown color (#C17E28). Below the header, on the left sidebar, include small links in golden brown for "Share" and "House," with the word "Labels" in black above the House link. The main content area, centered horizontally, contains blog posts with dates in small golden brown text above post titles in a dark gray serif font. Each post title is underlined with a thin horizontal line. Below the titles, include short excerpts in dark brown text. Under the post excerpt, provide a "Share" link and a label link in golden brown. Further down, show a "COMMENTS" heading in gray, and a "POPULAR POSTS" heading in smaller gray text. Below that, display two large blue rectangular images (source 'rick.jpg'), each followed by a date label in golden brown on the image's bottom left corner. Under each image, show the post title in dark gray serif font with share and comment links in golden brown beneath. The layout is spacious with plenty of white space and simple typographic hierarchy. At the bottom center, place a small light gray "Powered by Blogger" text.
