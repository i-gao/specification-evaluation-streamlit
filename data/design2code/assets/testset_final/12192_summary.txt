Create a clean webpage layout with a top horizontal blue navbar containing a small right-aligned white search input box. Below, a centered white content container on a light gray background. The main heading "PLUNK" uses a large, bold serif font in medium blue (#1A4B9C). Underneath is a small phonetic spelling in a delicate font, with a small blue circular info icon next to it. Then a boxed section with a light blue border contains a bold heading "Definitions of PLUNK" and four blue linked items in a vertical list. Below that, a small blue-outlined button labeled "Sort: Newest first" sits above a multi-section bullet-pointed list with some keywords in blue links and others in black, pairing normal and italic text, with section titles in bold medium blue font and right-aligned, italic gray subtext. Subsequent sections feature similar bullet lists in black text with many scattered bright blue links, repeating the heading style and subtext. At the bottom of definitions, a wide golden yellow banner with a bright blue rectangle (image) on top and small orange text below prompting "Install our FREE extension." Below that are two stacked blue rectangular panels with white text: the top panel includes a smaller bold heading, a slightly lighter subheading, bold paragraph text, and a faint link in a tiny font. The bottom panel shows a list of faint blue text links with right arrows on the right side, all inside a white container. The page ends with a wide blue footer bar containing small orange links and white paragraph text, all horizontally aligned and centered.
