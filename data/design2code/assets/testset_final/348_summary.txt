Create a clean, structured webpage with a light grayish-blue background and dark gray text. At the top, include a narrow light gray header bar with small centered text. Below, place a wide blue image on the left labeled "NEW ZEALAND" underneath and a smaller blue image on the top right corner. Beneath that, have a "Guides" section left-aligned and a simple search box on the right, both on a white background with subtle spacing. Next, center a large blue image representing an article hero banner. Below that, arrange the article content in a two-column layout: left column narrower with article metadata in small font and green accent highlights, and right column wider with the article title and text in dark gray with subtle green horizontal lines accentuating sections. Include a small blue image labeled "Follow us on" below the text. Under the article, create two side-by-side white boxes with thin gray borders and a list of related story headlines on the left and top stories on the right, each with subtle vertical dividing lines. Further down, place a small blue image left aligned, then an "Our Kiwi network" section with five blocks arranged horizontally, each block containing a smaller blue rectangular image on top and text below with links styled as small gray buttons. Separate the third block with a thin vertical green line. Underneath that row, add a second row with three similar blocks and matching styling. At the bottom, add a footer area on a white background with a row of small rectangular gray buttons labeled differently, left-aligned under "About us" text, and a final narrow dark gray footer with centered copyright text in small font. The font throughout is simple and sans-serif, predominantly dark gray with green highlights for links or emphasis.
