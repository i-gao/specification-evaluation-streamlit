Create a clean subscription form layout centered on a light gray background. Place a medium-sized blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg') centered at the top with a bold, black, center-aligned heading below it. Underneath, include a white rounded-corner form container with subtle shadows, containing a small intro paragraph, a labeled email input box with a light border, and three vertically spaced radio buttons with labels on the left. Below that, add a bold subheading followed by a block of small, dark gray text. Include a checkbox with a label to the left, and additional smaller text beneath. Place a small blue rectangle image (src='rick.jpg') aligned to the left within the text area, with inline text wrapping on the right. Below the form, add a wide, dark gray rectangular subscribe button with white text. Finally, at the bottom center of the page, add another medium blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg'). Use simple, legible fonts throughout with consistent spacing and alignment.
