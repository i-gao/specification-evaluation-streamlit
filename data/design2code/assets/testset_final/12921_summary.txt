Create a clean webpage layout with a white header containing a small blue square logo on the far left and a horizontal navigation menu with black uppercase text aligned to the right: "AUTO," "CONTRACTORS," "FOOD & DRINK," "HEALTH," "HOME & GARDEN," and "MORE." Below the header, place a full-width teal bar containing a horizontally centered white search input with rounded corners and subtle shadow, divided into two placeholder areas for "Auto shops, dentists, salons..." and "City, State or Zip" separated by a vertical line and a green accent highlight on the right edge.

Under the search bar, display breadcrumb navigation in teal and black text on a light gray background: "HEALTH & MEDICINE / CHIROPRACTOR." 

Below, create a wide white content card with a dark teal header bar labeled "BUSINESS" in small uppercase white text. On the left side of the card, place a medium blue square image placeholder (src "rick.jpg"). To the right, show black textual business info with bold headings and teal accent links, arranged vertically and spaced. 

Beneath that card, implement two white rectangular cards side by side on a light gray background. The left card is wider, containing a teal heading, smaller blue subheading link, and black paragraph text with standard font. The right card is narrower with a teal heading "Hours" and a bolded day list in black with hours aligned on the right side.

At the bottom, a full-width teal footer includes white copyright text on the left and right-aligned white text navigation links with spacing: "About Us," "Privacy Policy," "Editorial Policy," "Advertise," "Contact Us." Use clear fonts for readability throughout.
