Create a webpage with a light gray top bar containing a white "SEARCH..." text centered. Below it, place a white navigation bar with black text links aligned left: ABOUT US, SUSTAINABILITY, PROJECTS, ENVIRONMENT. The main background should be a muted blue-gray color. Inside the main content area, have a large white content box aligned left with black text and various paragraphs, headings, and links in dark gray and muted red. On the right side of this white box, add a vertical sidebar in a very light gray shade with pinkish-red active link text at top and other links in gray below, separated by thin lines. At the bottom, place a footer with a muted blue-gray background, a light gray bar above it, and three pinkish-red text links spaced horizontally: Privacy / Legal left, EMPLOYEE LOGIN center with a subtle underline, Contractor Safety Site right. The footerâ€™s bottom line contains a small centered copyright line in black. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout. Include a subtle shadow or border to separate sections clearly.
