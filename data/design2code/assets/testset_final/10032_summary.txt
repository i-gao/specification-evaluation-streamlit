Create a webpage with a black top navigation bar featuring a small blue square icon on the far left followed by white text menu items: "OpenPrescribing", "Analyse", "Area and Practice Dashboards", "Trends" (highlighted with a dark rectangle background), and "More." Below, display a clean white content area with a large black heading near the top left, followed by smaller black text and blue hyperlink text. Include a light blue notification box with a thin blue border containing black text and multiple blue links. At the bottom, add a light gray footer spanning full width with a few short blue hyperlinks on the left side in small text. Place a small black rectangular "Feedback" button in the bottom right corner. The overall layout is simple, clean, and uses standard sans-serif fonts.
