Create a webpage with a top header featuring a left-aligned blue square image (src 'rick.jpg') next to the site title in blue text, and a right-aligned minimal hamburger menu icon in blue. Below that, include a full-width gray banner with a large, bold white heading centered horizontally and a smaller italic white subtitle beneath it, plus a small sponsor line with a clickable link in light blue below the subtitle. The main content area is white with left-aligned black headings and paragraphs. Use small blue diamond-shaped bullet icons before bold subheadings and descriptive text lists. Near the bottom, center a white search input with subtle gray placeholder text next to a small outlined search button with dark text. The footer has a dark charcoal background with three columns of bold white headings and smaller blue text links aligned beneath each heading. Use a clean sans-serif font and maintain a minimalist, professional style throughout.
