Create a webpage layout featuring a white top header with a contact link on the left and a search input field aligned to the right, accompanied by a search button image labeled "Search" next to it. Below the header, include a dark navy horizontal navigation bar containing four evenly spaced text links. Under this navigation bar, the main content area should be divided into three sections: the left two-thirds split horizontally into a bright blue image (rick.jpg) on the left and a teal image (rick.jpg) on the right, with article text below spanning this width. The right third is a white sidebar with blue and teal text links, a bold navy heading, bullet points, and subtle horizontal lines dividing link groups. The entire content area and navigation bar sit on a dark navy background, and below them is a footer with small muted gray text on the same dark background. In the bottom right corner, place four small bright blue square buttons horizontally. Use simple sans-serif fonts and maintain a clean, professional design.
