Create a dark-themed webpage with a black background and a centered content container outlined in light gray. At the top, have a horizontal navigation bar with five equally spaced square buttons outlined in gray; the last four contain distinct white symbols centered vertically and horizontally: tilde (~), asterisk (*), #!, and question mark (?). Below that, display a large centered header with elegant, serif, white text, followed by a small date in gray aligned to the right. The main content area includes alternating dark and black horizontal strips that contain monospaced white text and paragraphs with varied shading, maintaining the dark theme. At the bottom right, place a small copyright line in gray text. Use a clean, monospaced font for the code sections and a classic serif font for headings and body text.
