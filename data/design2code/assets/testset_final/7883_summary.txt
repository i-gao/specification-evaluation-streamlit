Create a clean, white webpage layout with a top horizontal navigation bar. On the left side, include a small rounded blue square image, next to it the site name in bold dark gray text with a lighter gray tagline beneath. On the right side of the nav bar, add small black text navigation links spaced evenly. Below, display a bold, large heading, followed by a blue hyperlink, italicized introductory text, and multiple paragraphs in dark gray font with some bold, italic, and linked text. Use bullet points for lists with standard black dots, and make some list item text italicized. A subtle horizontal divider line separates the nav bar and page content. At the bottom center of the page is a light gray footer with three circular social media icons spaced evenly: an email icon, a GitHub icon, and a Twitter icon, each in their brand colors on a circular background. The font throughout is clean, sans-serif, with well-spaced line heights and margins for readability.
