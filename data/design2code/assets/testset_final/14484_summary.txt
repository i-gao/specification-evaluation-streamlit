Create a clean webpage with a black header bar containing the title on the left and three navigation links aligned on the right in white text using a simple sans-serif font. Center the page content with the heading "Vesta" in medium blue, below that a smaller, centered subheading in dark gray, followed by a table with three columns labeled "Type," "Feature Name," and "Origin." Use a light blue background for the header row of the table. The table text is in black with the feature names in a lighter blue as links. Include thin black horizontal lines separating each row. Add a horizontal line below the table and then a footer with small, gray text aligned left and right, containing links in blue. Use plenty of white space for a clean, minimalist look on a white background.
