Create a webpage layout with a white header containing a blue rectangular logo image on the left side, followed by four black bold navigation links centered horizontally. On the right side of the header, place two buttons side by side: a dark blue volunteer button with white text and a red donate button with white text. Below the header, center an orange "Log in" heading with a thin horizontal line beneath it. Underneath, create a login form area with tabs for "Log in," "Create new account," and "Reset your password" in blue text. The form fields should include bold labels "Username" and "Password" with red asterisks, input fields with light borders, and a dark blue rectangular login button with white text. The footer area has a light gray background with four columns: a small blue rectangular logo image on the left, and three columns of dark blue text content headings in uppercase with related links or information beneath, separated by vertical lines. At the bottom of the footer, place small dark blue copyright text aligned left and a company credit aligned right. Use serif fonts for headings and clean, legible fonts for body text, maintaining consistent spacing and alignment throughout.
