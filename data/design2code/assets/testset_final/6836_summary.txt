Create a clean, minimal webpage with a white background and a centered main content column. At the top left, place two small navigation links ("HOME" and "ABOUT") in a simple gray font. Below, a bold heading in black, sans-serif font is left-aligned. Under the heading, include a date in smaller, light gray text. The body text is dark gray, left-aligned, and uses a readable sans-serif font. Include two black rectangular code blocks with monospaced text inside; the text uses color-coded syntax highlighting (teal for some commands, orange for quoted strings). Within the text, embed small gray background inline code snippets and blue links with a lighter blue underline. At the bottom left, place a small solid blue square as a design element. Overall, use consistent spacing and alignment for a clean, readable layout.
