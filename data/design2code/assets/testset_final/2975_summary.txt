Create a clean, minimal webpage layout with a small square blue image (src='rick.jpg') aligned top-left, followed on the same line by black text with a bold label "DIGITAL ARCHIVE" then normal font text next to it. Below, place a larger blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg') centered horizontally. Beneath that image, align text content flush left with a large, black sans-serif font headline for the artist's name, the artwork title in italic, and year in normal font. Below the heading, list details in smaller black text with bold labels for Medium, Dimensions, Credit Line, Accession No., Paper/Support, and Inscriptions, each followed by normal font descriptive text. At the end, include a bold "Related Works" label and normal text listing related works. The overall style is simple, with black text on white background and the images in vivid blue.
