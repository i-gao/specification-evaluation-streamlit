Create a minimalist webpage centered vertically and horizontally with a white background. Place a medium-weight, dark gray heading near the top center with a smaller light gray subheading line below it. Below the text, add a single-line password input field with a light gray border. Under the input field, include a dark teal rectangular button with white bold text and slight border-radius. Finally, below the button, add a small line of dark gray text with a blue hyperlink at the end. The font should be clean and modern, and the layout should maintain ample white space around elements for clarity.
