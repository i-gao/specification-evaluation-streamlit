Create a webpage with a dark gray top navigation bar featuring a blue rectangular logo on the left, followed by menu items "Home" (highlighted in blue) "Forum," "Requests" in white, and a red "AppCake iOS App" on the right side along with a circular user icon. Below this, a breadcrumb navigation appears in small gray text. The main content area is white with a left sidebar containing a rounded blue square image at the top, two small blue outlined buttons underneath, and below them the app title and details in black and gray text with faint horizontal dividing lines. Further down are three smaller rounded blue square images stacked vertically with related labels. The main content to the right includes a rounded blue square image at the top left followed by descriptive text in black and gray. Below that, a section labeled "Video/Screenshots" with a smaller blue clickable link aligned right, followed by a large blue rectangular image representing a video. Beneath that is a "Download" section with small gray descriptive text, a large blue rectangular area with two smaller blue link buttons spaced vertically in the center, and a toggle button beneath. The footer includes small gray text with two blue clickable links. Use clean sans-serif fonts, consistent spacing, and subtle dividing lines in the layout.
