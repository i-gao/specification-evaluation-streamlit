Create a webpage with a bright yellow background and a centered top navigation menu containing four text links in a serif font, spaced evenly: "HOME," "ABOUT," "CAMPING," and "GLAMPING." The "HOME," "CAMPING," and "GLAMPING" links are in yellowish-green with underline, and "ABOUT" is black and bold. Below the navigation, position a large light gray container panel centered horizontally with padding. At the top-left inside this panel, place a heading in gray serif font. Below the heading and aligned left, place a rectangular blue image with a subtle white border and slight shadow. Under the image, include two lines of text in smaller gray serif font, with the first line normal weight and the second line starting with a bold dark green phrase followed by normal text.
