Create a webpage with a dark charcoal header and footer, each containing left-aligned text in a small, condensed sans-serif font in light gray. The headerâ€™s left side shows the site name stacked in two lines; the right side has a horizontally aligned navigation menu with small uppercase links spaced equally across the top. Centered below the header, place a large, wide rectangular blue image placeholder (src 'rick.jpg'). Beneath the image, centered text in uppercase and gray serves as a section heading. The main content area uses a two-column layout: the left column is wider with black headings and smaller gray body text in a clean sans-serif font. The right column is narrower with a bold heading, paragraph text, and a small outlined rectangular blue button with uppercase text and thin horizontal lines on each side. Below the columns, place two horizontally aligned buttons spaced apart in blue outlined rectangles with uppercase text and similar horizontal line accents. The footer repeats the navigation links centrally in small gray text, with bold white uppercase site name and location below, and a line of small gray copyright text. The overall style is minimalist and modern with consistent spacing and a monochromatic palette accented by blue buttons and the blue image.
