Create a layout with a top horizontal purple gradient header containing a search input box aligned right, plus two links ("Browse A-Z" and "Sign in") also right-aligned beneath the search. Below is a narrow white breadcrumb bar. The main content area is white with a left sidebar, main article content in the center, and a right sidebar. The left sidebar has a vertical menu with beige background and an orange highlight for the selected item, plus sections below with purple headings and text. Each sidebar section is in a light beige rounded rectangle, with two blue rectangles representing images. The center content includes a bold black page title, a purple date heading underlined with a beige horizontal line, and the article heading in black bold plus body text underneath in black. The right sidebar is a vertical rounded rectangle in light beige containing multiple sections with bold purple and black headings and black text links beneath. The footer is a wide purple gradient bar with light text links aligned left and a subtle black decorative element aligned right. Use sans-serif fonts for body and bold for headings, consistent spacing, and subtle rounding on boxes.
