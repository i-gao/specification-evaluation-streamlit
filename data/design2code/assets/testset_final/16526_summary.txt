The webpage layout features a light grey background with a wide white content area centered. At the top, there is a horizontal orange navigation bar spanning the width of the content area, containing small text links aligned left and a small blue square image (rick.jpg) on the right side. Below this bar, the main content is split into two columns: the left column contains headings, paragraphs, and a data table with a light grey header row and alternating white and light blue rows. The right column includes two vertical blue square images (rick.jpg) stacked with a light blue box containing metadata text between them; this box has a dark blue header with white text and a subtle drop shadow. At the bottom of the content area is a footer with a light blue background, including left-aligned bold and small text, a few small blue square images (rick.jpg), and a language selector dropdown. The fonts throughout are clean and sans-serif, with headings bolded.
