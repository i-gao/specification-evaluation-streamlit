Create a webpage with a purple header containing left-aligned bold white text, a small blue square image in the center, and right-aligned bold white text. Below the header, center a black text heading on a white background. The main content area features a large white card with a subtle shadow on a light gray background, divided horizontally into two sections: a large square white box with black bold text on the left, and on the right side, a small blue circular image followed by gray text arranged as headings and paragraphs, with a purple button aligned to the top right and a small blue square image inline in the instructions. Below, have a "Related Activities" section with bold dark brown heading and five small white cards spaced evenly, each containing a blue circular image top-left, gray names, black titles, and some icons including small blue squares. At the bottom, a white section with black and gray text left-aligned on the left half, a green rectangular button below, and a large blue square image on the right half. Finally, a dark brown footer spanning full width with small white text centered horizontally with four links spaced evenly. Use modern, clean fonts and consistent spacing. The blue squares correspond to images with src='rick.jpg'.
