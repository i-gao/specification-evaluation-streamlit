Create a webpage layout with a top horizontal header bar colored burnt orange containing white bold text aligned left and a small solid blue square on the right side. Below it, have a wide white spacer section. The main footer area should be a dark slate gray rectangle spanning full width, containing four columns of white text links evenly spaced horizontally. The first column includes a medium blue square image (use 'rick.jpg') above text links. The text is small, clean, and sans-serif throughout, with consistent spacing between lines and columns. The overall layout is clean, minimal, and structured with distinct color sections.
