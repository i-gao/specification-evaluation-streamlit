Create a clean, minimal contact page with a white background and a thin gray horizontal line separating sections. At the top, include a horizontal navigation bar with gray uppercase text links evenly spaced, with the last link in a red color. Below that, align the word "CONTACT" in red text toward the upper right side. Present contact information in small, gray, left-aligned text below that, using a simple sans-serif font. At the bottom, add a footer with centered, small gray text containing copyright info and contact placeholders. The overall design should be simple, subtle, and focused on text readability.
