Create a dark blue-gray full-screen background with a white monospaced font text block centered horizontally and vertically but aligned left inside the block. The text block includes a larger heading at the top, a smaller date line below, a horizontal thin line beneath that, followed by paragraph text with a code snippet styled as a small outlined rectangular box in the paragraph. At the bottom center, place a thin horizontal line with three small links spaced evenly below it. The overall style is minimalistic and uses consistent spacing with a subdued and clean design.
