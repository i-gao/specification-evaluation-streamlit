Create a centered webpage with a dark gray (#555) background behind a lighter gray (#555) content container. At the top, place a large white title in serif font "Rock 'n' Roll Soldier," followed immediately below by a smaller subtitle "A Memoir" in bold white, and then a smaller, light gray byline text in a sans-serif font. Under the header, include a bright blue horizontal navigation bar with white text links spaced evenly ("Vietnam Photo Gallery," "Watch," "Listen," "More Stories of the 127th"). Below that, show a left-aligned section title in white text. Then provide multiple paragraphs of body text in smaller white font. Below the text, center a large rectangular bright blue placeholder image (the actual image source should be 'rick.jpg'). Under the image, add a small, center-aligned caption in light gray text. At the bottom, include a separating line and a small footer with italic and normal text in gray, and a copyright symbol followed by the year, all left-aligned and in a small font. The layout should have subtle horizontal lines separating sections.
