Please create a blog layout with a light gray background (#eee) for the entire page and a white central content container with padding and subtle shadow. At the top left, place the site title in simple black text, "Daniel Solis," and align a white search box with subtle border on the top right. The main content area includes a post title in black, standard sans-serif font with a smaller italic subtitle beneath, followed by a bright blue rectangular image block with the source 'rick.jpg' underneath the title. Below the image, place black paragraph text in a clean serif font aligned left, with some text segments in monospace for code-like styling. Include small pink label tags near the bottom of the post content. Below the post container, add a bold heading "Archive" aligned left. At the bottom, create a gray horizontal footer with a lighter gray text button labeled "Past Posts" in the center and a red "Powered by Blogger" line below it, followed by a small black copyright notice. The overall styling is minimalistic, clean, with mostly black text on white and gray backgrounds, and accent colors in blue for images and pink/red for tags and footer text.
