Create a clean white background web layout with "vi per" aligned left and "Bookstore" centered horizontally in a large serif font at the top. Below "vi per," display two vertical columns of black text navigation links in a small sans-serif font. Centered beneath the header, include a short two-line paragraph in gray, followed by a centered heading "OPENING HOURS" in a medium serif font, then smaller centered body text underneath. On the bottom left, place address details in black sans-serif text above three small solid blue rectangles in a row and two below. On the bottom right, add three blocks of black text aligned right, each describing contact information. The overall style is minimal with black text, small blue rectangles as icons or buttons, and ample white space.
