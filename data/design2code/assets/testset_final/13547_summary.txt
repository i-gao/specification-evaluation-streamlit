Create a clean, centered blog post layout with a white background and black text. The header includes a bold logo on the left and a simple horizontal navigation with three links to the right in a small bold sans-serif font. Below, place a gray, small-sized date and reading time line above a bold, larger title centered horizontally. The main article uses a serif or sans-serif readable font for paragraphs with standard line spacing and includes underlined links in black. Include a light gray background block containing code with monospace font and subtle padding. Certain words in paragraphs are highlighted with a light gray background and monospace font styling. At the bottom, add an author section aligned left with a strong bold name, small uppercase location text in gray beneath it, and a circular blue avatar to the left. The footer is minimal with three small gray text links spaced across the width, left, center, and right. Ensure plenty of white space and a neat vertical rhythm throughout.
