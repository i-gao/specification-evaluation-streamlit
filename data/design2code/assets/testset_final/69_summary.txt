Create a web layout with a light gray background. Place a dark red rectangular header at the top left, and to its right include a narrower dark red horizontal bar with small white navigation links aligned left and a "Keyword Search" link aligned right in dark gray. Below the header, place a white breadcrumb navigation box with small black text and one red link. Below this, left-align a bold, dark teal heading in large font. Beneath the heading, place two white content boxes with light gray borders stacked vertically, containing black text with some bold and red highlights for emphasis. On the far right side, align a narrow vertical white sidebar with a faint red horizontal line, a small white text above, and below that dark gray and teal text links arranged vertically with bullet points. At the very bottom, include a thin horizontal gray line and a row of small, light gray footer links centered horizontally. Use simple, clean fonts with consistent spacing and alignment throughout.
