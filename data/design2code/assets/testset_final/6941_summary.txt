The webpage layout features a white top header with a small blue rectangular image/logo on the left and a simple horizontal navigation menu on the right with gray text links. Below the header is a full-width dark greenish-gray banner containing the site name aligned left and a small dark gray search bar with a magnifying glass icon aligned right. The main content area is white with black and dark gray text, using a clean sans-serif font, including headings in a slightly larger and darker gray style. There are four medium-sized square images with bright blue placeholders (src="rick.jpg") spaced vertically down the center, each with a light gray caption below. At the bottom, there is a small section of red text links with bullet squares, preceded by bolded introductory text. The footer is a dark greenish-gray bar spanning full width, with small white text links aligned left and a copyright notice aligned right, all in a subtle sans-serif font. The design is minimalistic, using mostly white and dark greenish-gray with accent blue images and red link highlights.
