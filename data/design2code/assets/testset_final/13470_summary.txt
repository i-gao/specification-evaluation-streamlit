Create a clean, white background webpage with a left-aligned layout. The main heading uses a bold, black serif font at the top left, with a slightly smaller but also bold subheading beneath it. Below the subheading, display the date in a small, muted gray font. The main content includes black body text in a readable serif font with standard line spacing. There are several light blue, rounded-corner code blocks with monospace font inside the main content for code snippets. Links within the code blocks appear in bright pink. At the bottom, include smaller navigation text in black for previous and next links. Finally, add a subtle horizontal line separator and a "Contact" label below it in smaller, black font.
