Create a webpage layout with a bright orange horizontal top bar spanning the full width, containing a black hamburger menu icon on the left made of three thick short horizontal lines stacked vertically. Below the bar, align the main content to the left with a clean white background. Use bold black font for the main heading "Pendelbahn" and standard black text for the descriptive content under it. Include multiple sections separated by thin horizontal lines with small, bold, black section headers in capital letters and slightly smaller font size, each followed by relevant text details. The layout should be simple and text-focused with clear hierarchy and no images except the orange top bar and menu icon.
