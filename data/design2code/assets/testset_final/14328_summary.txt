Create a clean, minimalist blog layout with a light gray background. Place the blog title in bright blue, bold, and medium-sized font near the top left, followed by a smaller, lighter blue subtitle below it. Below that, center a white content container with subtle drop shadow, containing the post title in dark gray bold font and the date beneath in smaller italic gray text. The post content uses black serif font with standard line spacing and includes bullet points. Insert a bright blue square image midway through the text. Below the post, show a comment section with user icon as a bright blue circle, user name and comment text in black, and timestamp in smaller gray text. At the bottom outside the container, show a sidebar with bold section headings in black, italic blue date text, a bright blue square thumbnail on the left, and excerpt text on the right, with a blue "READ MORE" link aligned bottom right. Footer includes small centered blue text links and gray attribution text. The overall font is a combination of serif for content and sans-serif for headings.
