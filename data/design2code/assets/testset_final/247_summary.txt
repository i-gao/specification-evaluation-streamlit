Create a web layout with a large horizontal bright blue banner at the top containing a right-aligned navigation menu with small red text links. Below the banner's right side, include a small rectangular search bar with a search button. Underneath the banner, a thin horizontal dashed line separates the header from the main content area. The main content is a three-column layout: the left column has left-aligned gray text description with some italicized parts, the center column features a title in pink text above italicized author text, followed by a poem in black text aligned left; the right column is empty. Below the main text, aligned left, is a small bright blue square image thumbnail with a bold caption below it and a pink link underneath. The footer spans the full width in a dark gray background with three sections: left has white text and a white input box for email subscription, center has white copyright text and address info stacked vertically, right has small gray text for design credits aligned to the right. Use simple sans-serif fonts throughout.
