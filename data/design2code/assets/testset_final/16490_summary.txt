Create a clean, minimal blog layout with a white background. At the top left, place the blog title in a large serif font, "SYLVIA LIU LAND," with a smaller subtitle below it in a sans-serif font. On the top right, have a small orange "SEARCH" link. Below the title, horizontally list simple black navigation links: "HOME · BOOKS · ABOUT." On the left sidebar, align a vertical list of small orange links including "Share," "Reviews," and "reviews: graphic novels," with a single black label "Labels" above them. The main content area is centered and contains a date in small black text, then a large serif post title, followed by a small gray underline line. Below, place a blue rectangular image block (with src 'rick.jpg') on the right side aligned with the text. The blog post text is in black, left-aligned, punctuated by subtle underlined links in black. At the bottom of the post, include a short bulleted list with orange links. Below the content, repeat small orange "Share" and "Email Post" links with a label line in orange. The footer is centered with small black text crediting "Powered by Blogger" and copyright info. Overall, the page is spacious with plenty of white space and uses serif fonts for titles and simple sans-serif for text, with consistent small orange accent links on the left and bottom.
