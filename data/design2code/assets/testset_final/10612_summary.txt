Create a clean, minimalistic wiki page layout with a pale blue horizontal navigation bar centered below the top area containing text links spaced with bullet points, using a simple sans-serif font for navigation. The main content area features a bold headline followed by a thin horizontal dividing line and standard paragraph text in black on white. On the left side, include a vertical sidebar with small blue text links grouped under two light grey headings, aligned flush left. The top right side displays small blue text "Create account" and "Log in" links above a rectangular search box with a subtle border. At the bottom right corner, place two small solid blue rectangular buttons side by side aligned horizontally. The entire background outside the content area is a very light grey.
