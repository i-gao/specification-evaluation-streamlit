Create a centered webpage with a dark slate blue background (#344154). At the top, place a horizontal light steel blue (#9bb7cd) header bar spanning the container's width containing white bold text with a subtle shadow for the title aligned left, and a smaller tagline beneath it in white. Below the header is a white content area with black text, containing links in a small, subtle underline style above a gray vertical line accent next to a bold gray heading. Include multiple paragraphs of black text with small font and line spacing. Insert a thin gray horizontal line separating content from the footer area containing timestamp text aligned right in small gray font with an underline hyperlink. Below, embed two sections with light steel blue backgrounds for their titles in uppercase white bold text on a darker rectangular label block aligned left. Within these sections, present text with a light gray background and thin dashed border for the trackback URL area and normal black text for other content. Finally, add a comment form with labeled text fields and a large multiline text area, a checkbox, and small black text instructions, plus two rectangular gray border buttons for preview and posting aligned left. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout with consistent spacing and margins.
