Create a minimalistic blog layout on a very light beige background with dark brown header text "MIDWEST LOTUS" aligned left at the top. Below that, place a small navigation menu in grey with simple text links ("HOME · ABOUT MANISHA · HELPFUL RESOURCES"). On the top right corner, add a small red "SEARCH" link. Center below the header a bold black tagline line, followed by a larger serif font subtitle. On the left side under the tagline, include small red share and label links stacked vertically in simple font. The main content area to the right features a section title in dark brown with an underline, followed by two large rectangular bright blue placeholders for images sized about 800x400 pixels, each with a caption below in small dark text. Below the images, show small red share and label links again. The page ends with a subtle "COMMENTS" label in grey and a small centered "Powered by Blogger" note at the bottom. The fonts should be clean serif for headings and simple sans-serif for smaller text.
