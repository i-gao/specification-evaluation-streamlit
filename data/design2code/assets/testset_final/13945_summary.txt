Create a centered profile section on a teal background with a blue circular profile image at the top. Below the image, place a bold dark gray heading for the name, followed by a smaller, regular gray subtitle text. Under that, include four equally spaced, full-width horizontal buttons with rounded corners in bright orange, each containing bold dark gray text and a small emoji on the right. Finally, add a bold dark gray tagline with a red heart emoji centered below the buttons. Use a clean sans-serif font and ensure the layout is vertically and horizontally centered on the page. The orange buttons should have consistent padding and spacing between them. The profile picture is an image with src 'rick.jpg'.
