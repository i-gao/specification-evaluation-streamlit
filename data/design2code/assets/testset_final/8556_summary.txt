Create a clean, white content box centered on a light gray background. Use a bold blue sans-serif font for the main heading at the top left. Below it, place a horizontal navigation with small gray text links and one blue button-style active link. On the top right, display a row of five small color squares in red, dark blue, light gold, green, and orange. Under the nav, include a section title in medium dark gray with wide letter spacing. The main content area has black text paragraphs with small blue bold subheadings on the left, aligned vertically. To the right side of this text, add two medium blue rectangular images stacked vertically. Below, a dotted horizontal line separates content from the footer area. In the footer, present two text blocks side by side with gray text and spaced letters, aligned left, with a larger blue rectangular image to the right. Another row of the five colored squares repeats above the footer bottom. The page footer line at the very bottom has small, centered gray text. Use consistent spacing, simple sans-serif fonts, and a minimal, organized layout. The blue rectangles are images with src 'rick.jpg'.
