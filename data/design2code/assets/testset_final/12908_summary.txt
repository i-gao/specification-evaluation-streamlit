Create a sleek, black-themed webpage layout with a top navigation bar containing the site logo on the left in bold white font and menu items (Home, Services, Gallery, Contact Us) aligned to the right in smaller white uppercase letters. The main header is centered and features a large, bold, white uppercase headline. Below the header, center aligned, is a smaller white text block for phone contact information. On the left side beneath that, include a prominent "About Us" section with a bold white heading, a thin underline, and smaller white and grey body text below describing the service. To the right side of the contact info, place a cookie consent box with a white background containing a bold heading, smaller explanatory text in gray, and a bold black "Accept" button beneath it. At the bottom, have a subtle footer in small grey text aligned left and right for copyright and powered by info. The entire style uses sans-serif fonts with clear spacing and a modern, minimalist aesthetic.
