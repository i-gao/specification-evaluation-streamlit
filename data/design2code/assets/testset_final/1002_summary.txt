Please create a simple, clean webpage layout with a small bright blue square image positioned at the top-left margin of the main content area. To the right and below the image, include a bold headline in black text. Underneath the headline, place several lines of regular black paragraph text spaced out with comfortable line height. Below the text, add a dark gray rectangular button with white text, sized moderately wide and with rounded corners. Under this button, place a smaller dark gray rectangular button with white text and rounded corners as well, aligned left with some vertical spacing between elements. Keep the background white and use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout.
