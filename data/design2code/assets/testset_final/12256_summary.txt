Create a dark-themed webpage with a black background. At the top left, place a simple horizontal navigation menu with three text links: "Work" (bold and white), "Info," and "Contact" (both in lighter gray). Centered at the top is the name "Laura Fisher" in a large, white, cursive font. Below the header, arrange four equally sized rectangular images (src='rick.jpg') in a 2x2 grid with consistent spacing. At the bottom center, add a small, light gray footer text reading "Powered by Adobe Portfolio."
