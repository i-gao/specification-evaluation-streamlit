Create a webpage with a dark brown background and very light beige text. At the top left, have a small navigation menu with links: Home, Search, Map, Gallery. Below that, a prominent white bold heading with a subheading in a lighter beige. Under these headings, display a short line of meta information in small font. Then, vertically stack three large, bright blue rectangles (which are placeholders for images with src 'rick.jpg'), each framed by a subtle dark border and spaced evenly. Below each image, include a small block of descriptive text in light beige. On the right side of the page, aligned vertically at about mid-height, add an "Explore" section with a bold heading and several navigational text lines, including a brown button shape below one of the lines. The page footer at the bottom left includes smaller text, and on the bottom right, small navigation links in a subtle color. Use a clean, sans-serif font with consistent spacing and alignment for readability.
