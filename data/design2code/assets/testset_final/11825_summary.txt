Create a webpage with a light gray background and a dark blue top header containing white text aligned to the right. Below that, place a white horizontal section with two images (src='rick.jpg') as large blue rectangles on left and right sides, leaving space between them. Next, add a dark gray horizontal navigation bar with menu items left-aligned; highlight the first menu item with a bright cyan background. The main content area is white with black text: a bold heading followed by multiple paragraphs and underlined blue links. To the right side of the content, include a light gray box with bold black subheading and multiple blue links. Below the content, show a bold subheading and a row of four smaller blue rectangle images (src='rick.jpg'). Finally, add a dark gray footer with three columns of white text links and bold headings. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
