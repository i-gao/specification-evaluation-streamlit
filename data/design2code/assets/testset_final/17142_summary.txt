Create a clean, minimalistic blog layout with a white background. At the top left, place a large, dark gray, serif-styled blog title with a subtle shadow effect, and below it a smaller, lighter gray tagline in a simple sans-serif font. To the right of this header, include a small search input box. Below the header, add a horizontal navigation bar with a dark charcoal background and rounded corners, containing four evenly spaced, small dark gray rounded buttons with light text. 

The main content area should be divided into two columns: a wide left column with black body text in a classic serif font for the blog post, and a right sidebar narrower column with a heading, small text, and a small placeholder image (blue square) vertically aligned. The blog post includes bold headers, italicized text, and justified paragraphs. Insert a medium blue square image on the left side within the post text. Above the sidebar content, place a thin black horizontal line. 

At the page bottom, center a simple pagination text with small navigation links. The footer includes small italicized copyright text centered. Use black and dark gray for text, with crisp spacing and a clean, structured look. All images placeholders should use src='rick.jpg'.
