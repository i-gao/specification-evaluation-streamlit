Create a clean, light-themed layout with a pale blue background and white content boxes. At the top, a wide, pale blue banner spans the page. Below, on the left side, place a white box labeled "Nearby words" in medium blue text, with a thin gray horizontal line beneath the heading and a vertical list of words in smaller brown font, each with a right-pointing arrow aligned right. Center top should have a white box for input with bold gray text above it and a blue clickable link on the right side of that line. Beneath that, a white box with a large blue heading containing partial brown text, followed by italicized blue text and descriptive bullet points with mixed blue and brown text. To the right side, a smaller white box titled "Word of the day" in bold blue text, containing a large blue word, a thin gray line, and smaller brown text beneath. Below the definition box and spanning the page width, place another large white box with a light blue heading that includes brown text, numbered entries combining black, brown, and blue fonts, and italicized gray text aligned right for citations. The footer is a pale blue rectangle with smaller, blue and brown text aligned left and right, containing company info and policy links with subtle spacing. Use clean sans-serif fonts with consistent spacing and subtle lines to separate content areas.
