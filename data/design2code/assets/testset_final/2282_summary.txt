Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background. At the top left, include a large pink serif font heading and beneath it a smaller italic gray subtitle. Align a teal "SEARCH" link at the top right. Below, add a horizontal navigation menu with teal text links spaced evenly. Beneath that, place a full-width teal banner with white bold text on the left and a "SHOW ALL" link aligned right. Follow with a bold, black newsletter subscription heading left aligned, an email field, and two text input fields below with thin gray borders. The subscribe button should be gray and disabled or inactive. At the bottom, present a teal large headline on the left with a gray date below it, followed by black body text and pink bold links for share, comments, read more, and more posts arranged horizontally. On the right side of this section, insert a square black image placeholder. The footer text "Powered by Blogger" should appear in small teal font centered at the bottom.
