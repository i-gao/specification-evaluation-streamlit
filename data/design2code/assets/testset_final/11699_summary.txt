Create a clean, centered web layout with a white background. Place two rectangular buttons at the top center: a white "Go Back" button with dark gray border and text, and a dark gray "Print" button with white text. Below those, include a checkbox labeled "Recipe Image" aligned left with three small rectangular buttons labeled "Smaller," "Normal," and "Larger" to the right, with the "Normal" button dark gray with white text, and the others white with dark text and borders. Below, create a light green rounded rectangle area containing the main content. On the left side inside this area, include bold, dark gray heading text, standard black paragraph text, and bold black subheadings with bullet lists and numbered lists in dark gray text. On the right side, place a large solid blue circular image representing user votes, sized proportionally to the container. The layout uses a simple sans-serif font with consistent spacing. At the bottom center outside the container, include small italicized text in dark gray.
