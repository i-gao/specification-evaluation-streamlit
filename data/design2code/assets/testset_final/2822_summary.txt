Create a centered card layout with a subtle drop shadow on a white background. At the top of the card, include a solid royal blue horizontal banner spanning the width. Below that, present a bulleted list with small blue dot icons and dark gray text for each item, aligned to the left with ample white space around. At the bottom, add a light gray rectangular footer area containing smaller, darker gray text with a bold blue hyperlink. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout. The entire card should be vertically arranged with distinct spacing between sections.
