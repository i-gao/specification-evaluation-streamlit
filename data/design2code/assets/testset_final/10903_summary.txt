The layout features a clean white background with two blue image placeholders ("rick.jpg") positioned horizontally at the top left and top right corners, the left image being larger. Below the left image is a horizontal navigation menu with four text buttons: "Home," "Members," "Papers," and "Projects." The "Members" button is highlighted with a light gray rectangular background and the text in bold orange. The main content area is split into two columns beneath the navigation: the left column contains blue hyperlinked text and black body text in a smaller font size; the right column includes black and gray text, with one bolded heading styled as a subheader. At the very bottom, a light gray footer spans the width of the page with right-aligned small blue hyperlink text next to gray text showing a last update date. The font is a clean, sans-serif style throughout.
