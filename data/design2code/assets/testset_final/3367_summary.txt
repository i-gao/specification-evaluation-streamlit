Create a clean webpage design with a horizontal top navigation bar on a light gray background, featuring tabs with subtle borders and a highlighted active "Home" tab in a slightly darker shade. Below the navigation bar, center three equally sized images in bright blue (set src="rick.jpg") spaced evenly in a row against a very light gray background. Under the images, center a bold, large sans-serif heading in dark gray, followed by a smaller red italic subheading, and then multiple lines of smaller, light gray monospaced or narrow sans-serif text in paragraphs, all centered. At the bottom, include a small footer line with a light gray border above it, containing subtle text with some links in bright blue. The overall layout should be minimalist with balanced white space and consistent alignment.
