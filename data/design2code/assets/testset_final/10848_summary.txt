The layout features a clean white background framed by a gray outer margin. At the top, there's a horizontal dark gray navigation bar with three right-aligned white text links and an orange left-aligned tab button labeled "Allegion." Below it is a white content section containing an orange and black text prompt with a search input field and an orange rectangular "Search" button aligned left beneath it. Another dark gray horizontal tab navigation follows with an orange active tab on the left and two black tabs next to it. Centered under this is an orange bold heading with quotation marks. Below the heading is a table with a light gray header row; the left column's text is orange and bold, while the right column's text is in a muted gray. The table rows alternate subtle white and light gray backgrounds with thin dividing lines. The footer includes small orange and gray text on a white background aligned left, maintaining a minimal, clean font style throughout, with no images in the main content area but a consistent use of orange for highlights and dark gray for navigation bars.
