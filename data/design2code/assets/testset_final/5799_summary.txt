Create a webpage layout with a vertical navigation bar on the left consisting of green rounded-corner buttons with white text. To the right of this nav bar, place a large rectangular image at the top spanning a wide area. Below this main image and still to the right of the nav, include a smaller rectangular image centered horizontally with text content around it. On the left below the large image and under the nav bar, have a block of left-aligned text in dark green headers and grey body text. On the right side under the smaller image, place a "Recent entries" section with a dark green heading and a vertical list of green text links with bullet points. Below the left text block, include a search input field with a green "Go" button. The font throughout is a clean sans-serif with dark green and grey text on a white background, and the images use the source 'rick.jpg'. The layout is symmetrical, clean, and easy to navigate.
