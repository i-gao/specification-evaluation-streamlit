Create a two-column webpage layout with a light grey (#f9f9f9) background on the right and white on the left. The left column is narrower and centered vertically, containing vertically stacked sections of text, each with a bold, italic heading in serif font and smaller, underlined links below. The right column is wider with a large, bold italic heading and smaller italic subheading beneath, all in serif font. Below that is a block of small, regular serif text. The overall font style is classic and clean, with subtle shading on the main heading on the right. The layout is minimalistic, with no images, and ample white space for clarity.
