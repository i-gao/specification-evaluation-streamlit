Create a dark-themed webpage with a black background and white text. At the top, place a left-aligned bold white logo "DUTCH'S BREWHOUSE" and a right-aligned horizontal navigation menu with items "HOME," "ABOUT US" (orange with an underline), "MENU," "SNAPS," and a vertical divider. Center the orange bold heading "OUR STORY" below the header. Under that, include a large blue rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg') centered on the page. Below the image, add centered light gray body text. Then, add a horizontal black band with the centered orange bold heading "SOCIAL." Below this, create a contact section split into two columns on a dark gray background: left column with a bold heading "Drop us a line!" above black input fields for Name, Email, Message, and an orange "SEND" button. On the right column, place a bold heading "Better yet, see us in person!" with smaller gray text details underneath and contact info including an orange link. Include an orange "GET DIRECTIONS" button below the form on the left side. Finally, add a centered footer with small light gray copyright and tagline text. Use a modern sans-serif font throughout.
