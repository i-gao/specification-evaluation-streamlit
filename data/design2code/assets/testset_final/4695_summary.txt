Create a clean, white-background webpage layout with a moderate top header featuring a site title in bold serif font and a thin horizontal line below. To the right of the title, place a simple top navigation with four evenly spaced links in uppercase black sans-serif font. Below, center a white banner box with black sans-serif text for a heading and italic subheading. The main content area is divided into two columns: the left column wider with a large rectangular placeholder image (src="rick.jpg") above a row of four small rectangular images below, spaced evenly. Beneath these images, left-aligned paragraphs with headings in bold black sans-serif font and body text in smaller, regular black sans-serif font. The right column is narrower with small textual details aligned right in grey, with a small vertical image placeholder below the details. Further below on the right column, grey headings with smaller italic notes and times in lighter grey, aligned left. At the bottom, a wide footer with two columns: left column with a list of four small red links with italic subtext, right column with a vertical bulleted list in grey with italic timestamps aligned to the right. Footer includes a small red link centered underneath, followed by a subtle credit line in small grey text. The layout uses black, grey, white, and dark blue for images, with consistent spacing and clean, minimal typography.
