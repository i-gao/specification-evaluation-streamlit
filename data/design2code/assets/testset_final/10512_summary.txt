Create a centered white container with rounded corners on a light gray background. At the top right inside the container, place three small, equally spaced, bright blue square buttons in a row. On the left side near the top of the container, include a bold blue heading in a clean sans-serif font. Below the heading, put two lines of smaller black text in a simple font. Centered near the bottom of the container is a medium-sized bright blue rectangle. The footer text in very small, light gray font is centered below the container.
