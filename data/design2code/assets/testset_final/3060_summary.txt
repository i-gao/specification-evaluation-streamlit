Create a clean, minimal webpage with a white background. At the top, include a horizontal navigation bar with the brand "GFED" in large, dark blue font on the left, followed by four blue text links: HOME, DATA, AR6 HISTORIC, and FIGURES spaced evenly in a row. Below the navigation, center the main content with a heading "Contact" in large dark gray font, underlined with a thin black line spanning most of the content width. Under this heading, place paragraph text in smaller dark gray font with some words in orange that are clickable links. After some vertical spacing, add another heading "Funding" styled identically to the first heading but smaller in size, also underlined with a black line. Below it, use a bulleted list with each bullet's text in black and certain phrases in orange, representing hyperlinks. The overall layout is simple with left-aligned text content and ample white space.
