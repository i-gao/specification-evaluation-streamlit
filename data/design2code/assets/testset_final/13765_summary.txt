The web layout features a clean, white header with the site title aligned left in a serif font with dark grey color, and a right-aligned navigation menu in light grey small text with vertical separators. Below the header is a large blue rectangular image area (use src='rick.jpg') spanning the full width, followed by a narrow dark navy horizontal bar containing a cookie consent message on the left and a white "Got It!" button on the right. Under this is another full-width blue section with a dark navy button aligned left labeled "Our Kitchens" in uppercase white serif text. The main content area is white with two columns: the left column includes several smaller blue image rectangles stacked in grid-like groups (these are also images with src='rick.jpg'), each with accompanying small grey text descriptions below or alongside them. The right column mirrors this structure with additional blue image rectangles and paragraphs of light grey text in a sans-serif style, featuring small navy buttons with uppercase white text such as "> Find Out More". The footer is dark navy with small, light grey text links horizontally aligned left and contact info right-aligned, and a copyright line below in even smaller light grey text. The overall color scheme is white backgrounds with navy and royal blue accents, small serif headers, and clean sans-serif body text.
