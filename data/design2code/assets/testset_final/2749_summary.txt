Create a minimalist webpage with a white background. Center-align all text vertically and horizontally. Use a bold, black sans-serif font for the main heading near the top that reads "H&Iグローバルリサーチ（株）". Below it, display two lines of regular-weight black text in Japanese, spaced evenly with comfortable line height. Beneath that, include two separate clickable hyperlinks in black with underline styling, spaced evenly with the text above and below them. The overall design should be clean and simple with no additional colors or images.
