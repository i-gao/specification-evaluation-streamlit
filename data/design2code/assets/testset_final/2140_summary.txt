Create a clean webpage layout with a light gray header bar spanning the top and the site title on the left in bright blue font, reading "Homework Online Study Guides." Below the header, divide the page into two sections: a narrow left sidebar with a very light gray background containing a vertical navigation menu in smaller blue text with nested bullet points and horizontal separators, and a wider right main content area with a white background. The main content area should have a bold black heading in a large font, followed by a slightly smaller subtitle in black, and two paragraphs of body text in black. Include two rectangular social share buttons below the text: a dark blue "Share on Facebook" button and a dark red "Share on Pinterest" button with white text inside them. At the bottom of the main content area, add a dark gray horizontal navigation bar with white text aligned to the right. Finally, include a footer below the content area with a white background, containing a copyright message and small blue links aligned center.
