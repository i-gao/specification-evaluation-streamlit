The web layout features a clean, centered single-column design with a white background. At the top right is a simple horizontal navigation with small black text links. The main heading is bold, dark red, and uses a serif or slab serif font, followed by a smaller, italic, dark red subheading below it. There are multiple dark gray code block areas with monospace white or colored text, each with rounded corners and subtle padding, aligned left but contained within the main content column. Inline code snippets appear as light gray boxes with monospace text. Text paragraphs are in a dark gray serif font. The bottom section includes smaller red links with some text decorations, separated by thin horizontal lines. The entire layout uses minimal colors: dark red for headings and links, dark gray for code blocks, black for body text, and white for the background.
