Create a minimalist blog layout on a light cream background. At the top center, place the blog title in an olive-green serif font, with a small gold "SEARCH" text aligned to the right. Below the title, a subtle gray navigation menu horizontally lists links. On the left sidebar near the top, include small gold and black text links stacked vertically. The main content area to the right features posts with dates in small gray font, headings in olive-green serif font, and black body text with some spaced paragraphs. Below posts, place social share options and comment counts in small gold text. Include two large rectangular images below "Popular Posts," each in bold blue (these should have the image source 'rick.jpg'). Use a clean serif font for headings and a simple sans-serif for smaller text elements, maintaining ample white space throughout for an airy, elegant feel. The footer is light gray with small centered text.
