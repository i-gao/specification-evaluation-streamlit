Please create a webpage with a bright green header and footer background. The header includes a white search bar aligned left and white text links "Log in" and "Cart" aligned right. Below the header on the left is the site title in green text and on the right are navigation links in smaller green font. Beneath that, show breadcrumb links in gray. The main section is split horizontally: on the left, a large blue rectangle image with src 'rick.jpg'; on the right, product details in dark gray text with a bright blue price and a blue "Add to Cart" button. Below that, product description text and social share buttons in blue, light blue, and red. Underneath, a green subheading "More from this collection" aligned left, and a horizontal row of four smaller blue rectangle images with src 'rick.jpg' evenly spaced. Beneath those small images, product titles and prices in gray text. The footer includes three columns of white text: "Quick Links" with two links, "Follow Us" with a single link in yellow, and "Newsletter" with sign-up text, an email input box, and a blue subscribe button. Centered at the bottom is copyright text in white and contact info with three yellow letter links aligned horizontally. Use clean, sans-serif fonts throughout.
