Create a clean, two-column forum layout primarily using grayscale with subtle black text and red accent lines dividing sections. The top navigation bar includes tabs labeled .NET, Java, Open Source, and Mobile in bold black font on a white background with a thin gray horizontal line beneath. On the right side of the header, place "Join us" and "Sign in" links in small gray text above a regional selection showing a small blue square for the United States. Below the header on the left side, display the forum post content with section titles in bold black font and timestamps in light gray. Include a reply box with a faint gray background and a "Post a reply" header in bold. On the right side, create a sidebar containing multiple boxes outlined by thin red lines with uppercase gray headers and black bold subheaders listing forum discussions, tutorials, quick links, and recent activity, each with smaller black link text under. The footer extends full width with multiple columns of informational links in bold and gray text. The entire design uses clean sans-serif fonts, minimal color, and straightforward alignment for easy readability and navigation.
