Create a dark-themed webpage with a black header containing a horizontal yellow navigation menu featuring items spaced evenly: Home, Swords, Jewellery, Occasions, Rob Miller. Below the header, center a yellowish-gold title with an underline, followed by four large blue image placeholders stacked vertically and each accompanied by small white descriptive text below. Then include a centered "Gallery" heading in the same yellowish-gold with a thin underline, followed by a horizontal row of four smaller blue image placeholders spaced evenly. Near the bottom, create a dark section with a faint border containing a centered "Get in touch" heading in yellowish-gold with a thin underline, left-aligned white text and a blue button or link styled text in bold blue, and a rectangular blue image placeholder on the right side. Finally, at the page bottom, add a dark footer with a thin horizontal line and small white text links on the left and a right-aligned address and copyright info in white. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
