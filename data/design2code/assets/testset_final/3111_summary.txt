Create a webpage layout with a dark maroon header containing a small blue rectangular logo on the left and a "Log in" link on the right in white text. Below the header, include a dark gray navigation bar with white breadcrumb text separated by slashes. Add a thin orange underline below this navigation bar. The main content area should have a white background with a large title in black text at the top left and a large blue rectangular image (representing 'rick.jpg') below the title aligned left. Below the image, include black text with various metadata and links in small brown text. On the right side, create a vertical sidebar with a light gray background containing a search bar with a white input field and a maroon search button, followed by radio buttons, and grouped navigational lists with individual items in white boxes and maroon headers highlighting the selected categories. The page footer should contain disclaimers and links in small brown text on a white background. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
