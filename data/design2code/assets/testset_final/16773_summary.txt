Create a clean blog layout with a dark gray angled header bar spanning the top, containing the blog title in large, bold, white uppercase font aligned left, and a small, white navigation menu with links spaced horizontally below it. The main content area below the header is white with black text. Center a large, bold headline in black, followed by a smaller gray subtitle beneath it. The body text is standard black font, left-aligned with standard paragraphs and embedded links in green text. Below the content, include a thin horizontal line, followed by footer navigation links in green aligned left and right, and a final bottom footer with a light gray background and small, muted text with green links. The overall font is a clean serif for text and bold sans-serif for the header, with plenty of white space around content.
