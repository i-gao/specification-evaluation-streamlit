Create a clean white background webpage with a narrow horizontal red dotted line and small dark blue text navigation at the top right, and two small bright blue square icons aligned horizontally next to it. Below the top section, place a left-aligned vertical sidebar with a large bright blue square image on top and a darker blue rectangular area below it containing a smaller bright blue square image framed in white with small black text underneath. To the right of this sidebar, place a wide horizontal bright blue banner at the top of the main content area, which includes left-aligned dark blue bold subheadings, black paragraph text, and spacing that reflects a formal announcement. At the bottom, place a bright blue horizontal bar spanning nearly full width with smaller bright blue rectangles aligned right and one at the bottom right margin. Include a thin black horizontal line above a row of small red text aligned left with a right arrow symbol preceding it. Use crisp, sans-serif fonts for a clean professional look throughout.
