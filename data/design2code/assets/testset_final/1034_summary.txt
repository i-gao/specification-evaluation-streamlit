Create a clean, white-background webpage with a top header. On the left side of the header, place the site title "Ficlets" in bold, bright orange serif font. To the right, a horizontal black navigation bar with three evenly spaced white text links: "Authors," "Stories," and "Tags." Below that, a left-aligned main content area with black serif text, including a bold heading for the author name and various paragraphs with mixed bold, italic, and regular styling. Under that, a subheading "Stories (79)" in bold, followed by a list of story titles in bright blue link text with smaller author name and publish date details in black underneath each. At the bottom, a light gray footer with small light blue links and copyright/license text in black aligned across the width. The font used throughout is a serif style. The layout is simple, text-focused, and uses black, white, orange, and blue colors for emphasis and navigation.
