The layout includes a dark blue header bar across the top with a bright blue rectangular logo on the left and three right-aligned navigation links ("Stream," "Articles," "Notes") in light text, with the middle link underlined. Below is a light beige content area with a left-aligned main article. The article uses a dark blue serif font for headings and a dark gray sans-serif font for body text. There are several red hyperlinks scattered throughout the text. Inside the article, two vertical blue bars highlight certain quotes. At the bottom of the content, there are two red angular buttons labeled “Previous Article” and “Next Article” angled slightly and placed side-by-side on the left. Beneath these is a centered box with a subtle shadow containing a smaller bright blue square image on the left and a compact block of text with red hyperlinks to the right. Finally, a solid bright red footer spans the page width at the very bottom with white text aligned to the left. The overall color scheme is blue, beige, red, and white, with distinct areas separated by whitespace. The webpage uses clean lines and subtle shadows to create a modern, readable design. The dark blue rectangles are images with src set to 'rick.jpg'.
