Create a centered webpage layout with a pale yellow (#f6e5ae) rectangular content area about 780px wide and 750px tall including a scrollable block of text describing trekking in Ladakh. On the left side outside the content box, place a small horizontal text line for "Text Size:" followed by three blue clickable letters A (for increasing or decreasing text size) arranged horizontally with small vertical arrows. Inside the content box, show a bold black header "Trekking in Ladakh" at top left, and below it multiple paragraphs of black body text in a clean sans-serif font. The page background outside the pale box is white. Center a small blue link "FiftySense.com" and below it "Email Us" under the content box. At the bottom center of the page, include a small black footer with the copyright text in a simple font. The overall style is minimalistic, with straightforward text alignment and no additional images or decorations.
