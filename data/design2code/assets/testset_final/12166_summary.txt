The layout features a clean white background with black text. At the top-right corner, a narrow black horizontal bar contains links for "Sign In," "Your Cart," and "Search" in white font. Below that, a simple horizontal navigation menu with black text links "Browse," "Open Access," "Requests," and "Publish" is centered. Below the menu, on the left side, there is a medium-sized blue rectangular image. To the right of the image is a heading in bold dark gray font, with additional smaller descriptive text and links beneath. Two prominent blue buttons with white text are stacked vertically under the description on the left side. Additional links and small black buttons with white text are aligned below. A horizontal dividing line separates this section from an italicized blockquote with a thin vertical blue line on the left. Under the blockquote is a "Description" heading in bold black text, followed by paragraph text in regular black font. At the bottom, a "You May Also Like" section displays two rows of evenly spaced smaller blue rectangular images, each with a short caption below in small black font. The footer has a solid dark blue background with three columns of white text links on top, an orange call-to-action button labeled "Sign Me Up!" in white font with rounded corners, and two larger blue rectangular images aligned side by side underneath. The entire page uses a simple, sans-serif font.
