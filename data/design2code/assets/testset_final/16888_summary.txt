Create a webpage with a top header section in medium green (#6CC26C) featuring the name "David Simpson" in a white, clean sans-serif font on the left, with the tagline below it in smaller white text. On the right side of the header, place a horizontal navigation menu with links labeled "Blog," "About," "Projects," and "Apps" in white, evenly spaced. Below the header, include a thin horizontal line in a lighter green. The main content area has a white background with black and dark gray text. The heading "Only release one version of each version of your software" should be bold and white in the green header area, aligned left with some padding. Below it, smaller text includes links highlighted in green and a black background label for tags. The body text is dark gray on white with some bold and green highlights for emphasis. Include a code block with a light gray border and monospace font. The footer uses a very light gray background (#EFEFEF) with small green social-like icons centered horizontally. Use a clean, readable sans-serif font throughout the page.
