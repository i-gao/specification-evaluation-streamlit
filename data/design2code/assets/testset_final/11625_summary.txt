Create a clean, minimalist e-commerce product page using a white background with dark gray text. At the top center, place the site title in a serif font: "Olive Bites Studio." On the left side of the header, add a small search icon with "Search" text, and on the right side, add several social media icons followed by a dark gray rectangular "CART (0)" button in uppercase. Below the header, center a simple horizontal navigation bar with links: Home, SHOP (with a dropdown arrow), Let's Chat, About Us. Below that, on the left, place a large rectangular product image (rick.jpg) in bright blue with four smaller vertical thumbnail images to its right, also blue rectangles. On the right side of the product image, display product details: product name in serif font, price below, brand info in a smaller font, then size and length dropdown selectors aligned vertically with labels on the left and selectors on the right. Under that, a quantity input box and a bold dark gray "ADD TO CART" button. Below the button, a description text block in smaller gray font with bullet points and star icons. At the bottom of this section, place a row of social share icons in a light gray font with "SHARE" label. Then a footer with links horizontally spaced: Shop (+), Search, Let's Chat, Terms & Conditions. Below that center a row of social icons. Underneath, a newsletter signup with a white email input field and a dark gray arrow button to the right. The very bottom is a large blue rectangle image (rick.jpg). Finally, below that, a row of small square blue rectangles (rick.jpg) aligned horizontally as additional placeholders. Use consistent small, clean fonts and subtle divider lines between sections.
