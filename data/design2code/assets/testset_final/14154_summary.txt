Create a webpage with a dark mauve background in the top and bottom sections and a white middle section for the main content. Centered at the top, place the bold, uppercase site title in large white font, with a smaller green subtitle below. Below that, horizontally align navigation links in small uppercase font with subtle vertical dividers, using red for the active link and white for others. Under the navigation, include a thin horizontal line and a short intro with a small red heading, a bold white subheading, and smaller muted text. The white main content area should be in two columns: a wide left section with black text paragraphs and bold headings, and a narrower right sidebar with a small heading, a bulleted list of blue hyperlinks, and a small closing note in muted text. The bottom section should be divided in three columns with small uppercase headings in white, muted text links, thin horizontal separators, and a small paragraph. On the far right in the bottom section, add four bright blue square social media icons aligned horizontally. Use clean sans-serif fonts throughout for a modern and readable appearance.
