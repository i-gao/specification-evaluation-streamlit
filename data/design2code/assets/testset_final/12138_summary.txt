Create a clean, white webpage layout with a top section containing a large bright blue image on the left and a text block on the right, using simple black font for the heading and paragraphs. Below, center a heading and two lines of smaller black text on white background. Next, include a full-width bright orange subscription bar with black text for the heading and subheading on the left, and an email input field plus a black "SUBSCRIBE" button with yellow text on the right. Below that, add a large light gray box centered on the page containing a large bright blue image at the top, a short line of black text below it, followed by a label and a wide white password input field with an orange "ENTER" button to its right. At the very bottom, center a small line of black text with an orange clickable link. Use sans-serif fonts throughout and ensure clean spacing and alignment.
