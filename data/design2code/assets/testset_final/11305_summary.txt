Create a webpage with a clean, light background and a top navigation bar featuring a solid bright blue square logo on the left and simple gray text links: Home, About Us, Reviews, Gadgets spaced evenly. To the right, place two phone icons in subtle gray, one inside a rounded white rectangular background. Below, divide the main content area into a large white card with subtle rounded corners and a sidebar on the right. The main card contains a small red breadcrumb, a main title in large, dark gray sans-serif font, and a circular orange outline author icon with textual details beside it. Below is a large bright blue rectangular image placeholder (src 'rick.jpg'). Then multiple paragraphs of body text in smaller dark gray font, with some bold subheadings in dark gray. Include a tag section with small rounded pill-shaped tags in gray and blue backgrounds, and a row of rectangular social share buttons in dark blue, bright blue, and green. The right sidebar includes a "Follow us" heading, followed by four horizontally arranged rectangular color-coded buttons in red, navy blue, cyan, and a pink-to-purple gradient. Under "Popular Articles," show a vertically stacked set of small cards with subtle rounded corners and shadows. The top card is a large grayscale gradient rectangle with a small orange pill label in top left and text in white, while below are smaller cards with faint square image placeholders and text to the right. Then a "Main Tags" white card with four small bright orange pill-shaped tags arranged in two rows. The page footer features a narrow dark navy bar with a small bright blue square logo on the left, a brief About Us paragraph in black text, and four evenly spaced small translucent squares on the right. Below that is a darker navy band with centered white copyright text on the left and navigation links in white on the right. Use consistent spacing and a modern, minimalist font throughout.
