Create a webpage layout with a white background and a top header containing small, dark purple text links aligned right for navigation. Below the header, have a wide dark teal-blue banner with a large white centered title text. Beneath the banner, display the main content area with left-aligned text in a combination of dark gray and purple for headings, including bullet points and hyperlinks in purple. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout. At the bottom, include a full-width dark purple footer with smaller white text: an address line in bold and legal/license info above horizontal links in white aligned left. The font size is legible, and the page uses ample white space for readability.
