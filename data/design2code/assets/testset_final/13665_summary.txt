Please create a webpage layout with a black header containing a small bright blue rectangular logo on the left, and on the right side, small gray text navigation links spaced horizontally, followed by a gradient silver "RESERVATIONS" button. Below that, a white text horizontal menu with options spaced across the width on the right side. The main banner below the header is black with large, elegant white serif text aligned to the left displaying the page title and a smaller white sans-serif subtitle below it. Under the banner, the page background is white with a left sidebar navigation column listing multiple links in small black text vertically aligned, and below those a large gradient silver button labeled "CONTACT AN EVENT PLANNER." The main content area to the right includes a bold black header with large sans-serif text and smaller subtitle below it, followed by paragraph text and a bold subheading with a bulleted list in the same black font. On the right side near the top of the content area, include a small "SHARE:" label. The footer is black with small white text horizontally centered and spaced across the width, and below that a row of four small colored square icons in blues and red aligned centrally. The fonts used are a mix of serif for headings and clean sans-serif for body and UI text.
