Create a web layout with a top search bar horizontally centered over a light gray background. Below that, include a navigation line with "Browse reviews by:" in gray text, followed by clickable purple links labeled "Title Author Grade School/Group" spaced evenly. Underneath, place a wide purple horizontal banner across the page. Below the banner, in a white content area, center a dark gray main heading in uppercase, then smaller black subtext lines, followed by a bold black reviewer name. Center a bright blue rectangular image below the reviewer name. Beneath the image, add three short paragraphs of black body text aligned left but contained in a narrower column centered horizontally. At the bottom center above the footer, place smaller light purple text lines with a reviewer name link and class information. Finally, add a full-width purple footer with small white text centered. Use clean sans-serif fonts and balanced spacing throughout. The images include the top banner as the purple rectangle and the bright blue rectangle as the review image.
