The webpage layout features a clean, minimalist design with a white background. At the top left, the site title "Perlbuzz" is displayed in a classic serif font in dark gray, with a top navigation menu aligned horizontally to the right containing simple text links in black. Below that, a large heading in a prominent, elegant serif font states the main article title in black. Underneath the title, a smaller line of metadata in a lighter gray font shows the date, author, and category links in muted blue. The article body text is in a readable serif font in dark gray with normal weight, including some blue hyperlinks for emphasis and a lightly shaded blockquote in italic, gray text with a vertical light gray border on the left. At the bottom center is a footer in smaller gray text with subtle blue links. The overall color scheme is black, dark gray, light gray, and muted blue. The layout is centered with wide margins on either side, promoting focus on the text content without any distracting elements or images.
