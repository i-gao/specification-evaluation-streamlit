The layout features a clean, minimalistic forum page with a white background and dark gray text. At the top left is a bright blue rectangular logo area. Below that is a horizontal navy blue line spanning the width. The main content area is centered and includes a page title aligned left, with a small rounded light gray tag button next to it. User avatar circles appear on the left of each message, with some avatars in vibrant blue and others in very light gray. The messages themselves are contained in light gray-bordered white boxes with subtle rounded corners. On the right side is a vertical sidebar that includes a white search input with a light gray border and a stack of rectangular light gray buttons and sections with subtle, minimal typography in blue and gray. The top right corner has small text links for "Sign Up" and "Log In" in dark gray, plus a prominent light gray rounded button for starting a new conversation. The overall font style is modern and sans-serif, with blue used sparingly for links and highlights, and light gray for subtle UI elements. The layout balances whitespace and content, creating an airy, easy-to-read forum discussion page.
