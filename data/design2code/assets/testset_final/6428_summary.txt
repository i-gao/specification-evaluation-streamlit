The layout features a clean white background with navy blue text. At the top left is a small blue square for a logo image. Aligned horizontally near the top center-right is a navy blue navigation menu with four links, the last being a red rounded button labeled "Login." Below the header, left-aligned, is a large bold navy blue headline with a smaller grey date beneath it. A large blue rectangular image ('rick.jpg') spans most of the page width beneath the headline. Below that, a block of text is left-aligned in navy blue for the subheader and dark grey for the body content, arranged in paragraphs with a bold navy blue call-to-action link at the end. At the bottom left corner is a small blue square image likely for a secondary logo. Footer text in small, light grey font is aligned right, including an acknowledgment statement and links, with a credit line bottom right. The overall font is modern and sans-serif, with clear spacing and distinct color contrasts for emphasis.
