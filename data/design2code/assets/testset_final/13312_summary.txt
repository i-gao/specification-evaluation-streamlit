Create a centered webpage with a light gray rounded rectangle container holding all content. At the top left inside the container, place a rectangular blue image with the source set to 'rick.jpg'. On the top right inside the container, add a horizontal green text navigation menu with four links spaced equally: "Gallery", "Commissions", "Résumé", and "Contact" in bold. Below that, center an underlined black bold heading "Gallery" with a thin green horizontal line beneath it. Under the heading, place a large rectangular blue image (src 'rick.jpg') with a thin black border, centered horizontally. Below the large image, include a short green bold caption text centered. Finally, add two lines of black paragraph text and below them a small green bold "Back" link, also centered. Use a clean sans-serif font for all text.
