Create a web layout with a large rectangular image at the top, centered horizontally, using the source 'rick.jpg' with a rich blue background color. Below the image, place a wide dark gray container with rounded corners that contains left-aligned text. Use a bold, larger, light gray font for the heading and smaller, regular light gray font for the paragraphs. Include a smaller blue link text at the bottom left within the container. The background of the page should be white with generous spacing around the content.
