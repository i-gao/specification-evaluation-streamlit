Create a clean webpage with a dark charcoal gray header spanning full width, containing the site title "Famous Quotes" in a large, light gray serif font on the left and a subtle tagline beneath it in a smaller serif font. On the right side of the header, horizontally align navigation links in small, light gray serif font spaced evenly: HOME, QUOTES ABOUT LOVE, INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES, FRIENDS. Below the header, the main content area is white with a two-column layout. The left column lists categories with the heading "Categories" in a medium gray serif font, each category name in smaller gray serif font separated by thin dotted horizontal lines. The right column displays a heading "FAMOUS QUOTES FROM ..." in medium gray serif font, followed by a light gray search input bar. Underneath, show bullet-pointed quotes in a small, light gray serif font with important names and links in bright orange and bold styling for emphasis. Finally, include a dark charcoal footer full width with small, light gray serif text aligned left and right for copyright and site info.
