Create a webpage with a dark theme and a black top banner containing a short policy message in small gray text. Below that, include a light gray horizontal navigation bar with a small blue rectangle image on the left and four menu items aligned to the right using a clean, modern sans-serif font in black. Under the nav bar, place a full-width section with a medium gray background containing a centered white rounded rectangle box with a heading, subheading, and a black rectangular button. Further down, include a black background "Admission" section with the title centered in a distinctive stylized font in medium gray. Below the heading, display two admission categories side by side with their respective prices in a neat, minimalist style using gray text and consistent spacing. Add a small, subtle note centered beneath the prices in very small light gray text. At the bottom, have a footer also with black background featuring copyright and credits aligned left and a small label aligned right, all in small, light gray text with some link styling for certain text elements. The overall font should be clean and modern, readable against the dark backgrounds.
