The layout features a black horizontal top navigation bar with white text links aligned left. Below that is a wide light gray header section containing a prominent title in large dark gray font and a smaller, lighter gray subtitle next to it. The main content area is split into a larger left column with black body text on a white background, including inline code blocks with a light gray background and blue syntax highlighting. The right column has smaller, gray headings labeled "Published" and "Tags." The tags appear as small rounded rectangles in light blue with darker blue text. Beneath the tags is a bright blue rectangular image placeholder (use src='rick.jpg'). Below that is a list of blue text links and a small italicized quote. At the bottom of the left column is a horizontal button group with three pale buttons labeled navigation. The entire layout uses a clean, sans-serif font with good whitespace and subtle horizontal separators. The page background is a very light gray with a white content container centered.
