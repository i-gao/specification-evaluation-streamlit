Create a webpage with a top dark gray notification bar containing centered white text and two right-aligned blue hyperlinks. Below it, a horizontal blue header bar features a small blue square image on the left (use 'rick.jpg'), white bold text next to it, a right-aligned rectangular search input box in a slightly darker blue shade, and right-aligned white hyperlink text. The main content area should have a white background with a left sidebar containing a vertical menu in small gray and black text, aligned top-left with some spacing. The central content area displays a large section title in gray, with multiple black section subtitles below, each followed by paragraphs of black body text and some blue hyperlinks. Include a light gray code block in the text with a monospace font and subtle background. The page ends with a thin gray horizontal line and faint gray timestamp text aligned left above a black footer bar that contains two lines of small gray text, left-aligned. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout and ensure neat spacing and alignment between sections.
