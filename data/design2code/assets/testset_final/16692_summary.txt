Create a clean webpage layout with a white top navigation bar containing a small solid blue square on the left and horizontally arranged black text links spaced evenly across the top (AUTO, CONTRACTORS, FOOD & DRINK, HEALTH, HOME & GARDEN, MORE). Below the navigation is a wide teal-green horizontal banner with a centrally aligned search bar that has rounded corners and a two-tone background with white and green input sections. The main content area on a light gray background features a breadcrumb navigation line in green text above a white card with a small dark blue image (src 'rick.jpg') on the left side and black and green text with bold sublinks on the right. Beneath this is a white two-column section: the left column is a larger white card with teal heading text, black body text, and some blue linked text, and the right column is a smaller light gray square with a teal heading. The footer is a full-width teal-green bar containing small white text on the left and right aligned white navigation links spaced horizontally. Use clean, sans-serif fonts throughout.
