Create a minimalist webpage with an olive-green background. Center-left on the page, display a white bold heading in a sans-serif font, followed by a smaller bold subheading. Below that, include normal-weight white paragraph text with some bold labels interspersed. At the very bottom center of the page, add a small line of white footer text. The layout is clean and simple with no images or additional shapes, focusing on clear typography and consistent spacing.
