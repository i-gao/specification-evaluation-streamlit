Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background and a top fixed header bar. The header bar should be light gray and contain the site owner's name aligned left in a simple black font and navigation links "Publications" and "Personal" aligned to the right in black text. Below the header, structure the main content area into two columns. On the left, place text content in black with blue hyperlink text for references and links, using a simple sans-serif font. On the right, include a medium-sized bright blue ellipse shape positioned at the top right next to the text for a visual element. At the bottom of the page, add a footer with three columns containing small blue links and gray descriptive text for contact and additional info, aligned horizontally on a white background, separated from the main content by a thin gray horizontal line. The overall layout should be spacious and well-organized with clear hierarchy in text size for headings and body text.
