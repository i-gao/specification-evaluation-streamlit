Please create a webpage with a light blue header bar containing centered black text in a simple sans-serif font for the main title. Below that, add a narrow light green horizontal bar with a small tagline in black, monospaced font, also centered. Beneath these, place two main sections side by side in a white background: a larger left section with a vertical rectangular container having a thin gray border and rounded corners, containing black text with headings in bold and some underlined links, organized in bullet points; and a smaller right sidebar with a similar styled container that includes smaller black text links and a bold contact info heading with contact details. Finally, add a fixed-height light green footer bar with a thin black border at top containing horizontally aligned, spaced black links and a copyright line below, all centered in a monospaced font. The overall layout should be clean and minimal with consistent margins and spacing.
