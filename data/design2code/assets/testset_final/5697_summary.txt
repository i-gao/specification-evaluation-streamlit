Create a clean, two-column blog layout on a light beige background. Use a serif font for the main headings in dark brown, positioned top-left, and a smaller sans-serif font for subheading text below it. The right side top corner should have a small "SEARCH" link in muted red. The left sidebar includes a small list of clickable labels in muted red with a "Share" link above them. The main content column features a blog post title in bold dark brown with a thin horizontal line beneath, followed by black body text paragraphs in a serif font aligned left. Below the text are additional links in muted red. At the bottom of the content column, show post sharing options and label tags in small muted red text. Underneath the main post area, include two large horizontal rectangular blocks with a light pink background containing post dates in muted brown, bold dark brown post titles, and red share/post comment links. The footer area is small, centered, and contains faint grey text. The overall layout is minimal and uses spacing to separate sections clearly.
