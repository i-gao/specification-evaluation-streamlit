Create a webpage with a dark gray horizontal header bar at the top containing white text brand name on the left and four right-aligned navigation links styled bold and white. Below the header, center a black "Welcome" heading on a very light gray background. Under the heading, place a large bright blue rectangular image area centered horizontally to represent the main content image with src set to "rick.jpg". At the bottom, add a dark gray footer bar spanning the width with small white bold text aligned left. Use serif fonts for headings and maintain a clean, minimal layout.
