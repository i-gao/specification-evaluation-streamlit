Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background and a left sidebar in light blue. The sidebar contains four small square icons stacked vertically with vertical labels in light gray text next to each icon. At the top left, place a larger blue square image next to a blue "MyRobotLab" logo text on a white background with the sidebar behind it. At the top right, include a horizontal navigation menu with black bold text links "Documentation," "Download," "FAQs," "Forums," separated by a vertical line before "Log in." Below, the main content area has a breadcrumb navigation in smaller blue text, followed by a threaded discussion layout with user avatars as light gray circles and user names in bold, message text in regular black font, and clickable blue links for post titles and navigation like "Getting Started," "Log in," and "register." The layout uses clean spacing and subtle horizontal lines to separate posts.
