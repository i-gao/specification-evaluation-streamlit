Create a webpage with a vertical left sidebar that includes a small blue image (src='rick.jpg') on top. Below it, display a vertical list of menu links in varying colors: some bright orange (#FFA500) and others light gray. To the right of the sidebar, have a large blue rectangular banner image (src='rick.jpg') spanning horizontally. Below this banner, create a row of three black text links evenly spaced horizontally. Under that row, place a large blue rectangular content area (src='rick.jpg') extending the same width as the banner above. Finally, below this content box, add another row of three black text links evenly spaced horizontally. The background is white, fonts are sans-serif and the text is small and clean. The layout is minimalist with a focus on blue images and simple, concise text navigation.
