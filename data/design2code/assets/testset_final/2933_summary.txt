Create a clean, white-background wiki-style page with a fixed left sidebar in light gray containing multiple sections of small blue text links for navigation and tools. At the top, include a narrow horizontal navigation bar with small blue links "Page" and "Discussion" tabs and additional blue links "View source" and "View history" on the right, alongside a search input field on the right side. Below this, place the main content area with a black, serif-font title underlined with a thin line, followed by blue italic text links scattered inline with normal black paragraph text. Include a bordered right-floating contents box with a gray border and black text links in blue. Headings for sections and subsections should be in a black serif font separated by thin gray horizontal lines. The page features a multi-colored table near the bottom with pastel shades of lavender, light blue, light green, light yellow, and light red for various cells, with small black text, bold headers, and text aligned center in some cells. At the bottom of the content is a light gray bordered category box with blue links. The page footer area is minimal with tiny blue links on a white background and a bright blue rectangular block aligned to the right bottom corner.
