Create a clean, mostly white blog layout with a simple vertical brown-gray left border line on the far left. Place a centered header at the top with large black serif text for the site title. Below it, position a wide blue image (src='rick.jpg') aligned left under the header, with a black text horizontal navigation menu below it aligned left. On the top right corner of the page, add a small "SEARCH" link in a subtle brown color. Below the navigation on the left side, include a vertical list of brown links labeled "Share" and "Labels," with three sub-links in the same brown color below "Labels." The main content area (to the right of the left menu) should show a black serif post title, date, and author line at the top, followed by a horizontal black rule line. Below that, a black serif paragraph, then a large blue image (src='rick.jpg') aligned left with black caption text below it. Additional text paragraphs follow, with a second smaller blue image (src='rick.jpg') centered below with a caption in small black text underneath. The footer area includes share and email post links in the same brown color aligned left, with additional labels in brown text below, and a small "Powered by Blogger" line centered at the bottom in black. The font should be a classic serif for headings and paragraphs, and sans-serif for smaller details and navigation. The overall design is minimalist with white background and brown accent text.
