Create a clean, professional webpage with a white background and subtle grey horizontal navigation bar near the top containing four text links: About Us, Our Focus, Projects (bold and dark red), and Clients, centrally aligned. Above the navigation bar, align a dark red italic tagline on the right. On the left side beneath the nav bar, include a vertically stacked light grey menu with multiple project links, with some text in dark blue and others in dark red. Below this menu, add a centered light grey rounded rectangle box with bold black text above it and white bold labels inside. The main content is right of the menu, featuring a bold dark blue heading above a large vibrant blue rectangular image. Below the image, present project details with some labels bolded in black, followed by smaller body text paragraphs. The footer area, near the bottom, includes small grey text aligned left, plus a small horizontal menu aligned right and bottom right squares of light grey. Use sans-serif fonts for body text and a consistent clean style throughout.
