The web layout features a dark gray header with subtle curved overlay highlights and a small bright blue square image (src='rick.jpg') positioned in the top-left corner. Below the header is a horizontal pink line spanning nearly the entire width. Underneath, the main content area has a light gray background section for the page title, followed by a large white content block with dark gray text. At the bottom, a dark gray footer is divided into multiple columns of lightly separated text links in white and gray, with subtle horizontal dividing lines. Below these columns are several horizontal news headline links separated by thin lines, also in light gray text. The very bottom has a narrower dark gray bar containing a copyright notice in small gray font aligned center and a few small circular social media icons on the right side. The overall font is a clean, sans-serif style and the layout is centered with generous padding and rounded corners.
