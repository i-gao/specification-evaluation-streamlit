Please create a centered web layout with a narrow vertical header bar in dark navy blue on top. Below it, add a large navy blue rectangular banner containing a smaller blackish navy label at the upper left with white and light blue text inside. Under that label, place white text lines in a serif font. Below that at the bottom left corner of the banner, add a small horizontal light blue underline link. After the banner, show a white background content section with a small bold uppercase heading in a dark gray-blue color, followed by a salmon-pink horizontal box with red text inside it for alerts or notices. Below that, present a multi-post message board style list with user names on the left in bold and smaller label text beneath, and user content on the right in a serif font with subtle gray lines dividing posts. Use subtle horizontal lines and small blue link indicators for post timestamps and interaction links. At the bottom, include a narrower loading or closing info section with smaller text and horizontal lines. Use a clean, serif font for body text and a Sans-serif for headings and links, with a color palette primarily of navy blue, white, light blue, subtle gray lines, and salmon pink highlight. The dark navy rectangles in the header and banner should be replaced with images with src 'rick.jpg'.
