Create a clean, white background webpage with a large serif font header centered at the top reading "U+CCFD Hangul Syllable Cyeb." Below the header, display a paragraph block aligned left with black body text containing red hyperlinks scattered throughout for emphasis. On the left side beneath the paragraph, place a narrow vertical key-value table with gray labels and red values for categories like "General Category," "Script," and "Bidirectional Category." Then, add distinct subheaders for "Representations," "Elsewhere," and "Complete Record" in large black serif font spaced vertically. Under "Representations," center a small table with black headers and values in monospace. Under "Elsewhere," list bullet points with some red link text. Under "Complete Record," center a two-column table with bold black left column headers and red text values in the right column. Add a subtle footer line with small gray text and a bold black version number in the center bottom. Ensure a clean, structured layout with consistent spacing and a minimalistic style.
