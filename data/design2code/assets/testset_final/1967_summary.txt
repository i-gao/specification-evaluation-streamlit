Create a webpage layout with a white background and a large gray footer at the bottom. At the top, have a horizontal red navigation bar with white text links spaced evenly. Below and to the left, place a vertical rectangular blue image. To the right of this image, have a wide horizontal blue image spanning most of the content width. Below this, include a breadcrumb area with light gray background and small gray text. Beneath that, create a large white content box with a thin light gray border, containing black and dark gray text and a small table with gray headers. To the right side of this content box, place a narrow vertical blue image. The footer area should be solid gray with small, light gray text arranged in three columns. Use simple, clean sans-serif fonts for all text.
