Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a very light off-white background. At the top, include a small bright blue square logo on the left and a horizontal navigation menu on the right with simple, white text links spaced evenly. Beneath that, place a large, wide rectangular image placeholder ('rick.jpg') with a thin light gray border and subtle shadow. Below the large image, add three main content sections separated by thin light gray horizontal lines. The first section has a left-aligned heading in bold, dark gray font and smaller, light gray body text below it spanning the width. The second section is split horizontally: on the left a block of text with bullet points in dark and light gray text, and on the right a medium-sized bright blue rectangular image. The third section has a large bold heading on the left with a smaller bright blue rectangular image below it, and on the right a paragraph with some bold text and links in bright blue. At the bottom center, place four small square icons with subtle shadows spaced evenly, below that line of small footer text in gray with links aligned horizontally. Use a modern sans-serif font throughout for readability.
