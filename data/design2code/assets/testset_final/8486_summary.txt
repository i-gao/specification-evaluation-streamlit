Create a minimalistic "coming soon" webpage with a clean white background. Centered near the top is a bold, gray heading in a sans-serif font reading "FirstFishOnline," with a smaller uppercase "COMING SOON" subtitle below it. Below that, place a lighter gray paragraph and a bold line of text inviting users to subscribe. Include a horizontal email subscription input with a white rectangular text input field followed by a medium blue button labeled "NOTIFY ME" in white uppercase text. Below the input, add a bold "Spread the word" label centered, followed by three small rectangular white buttons with subtle gray borders labeled "SHARE," "TWEET," and "PIN IT" in uppercase. In the top right corner, add a small white button with a gray border and uppercase text reading "ENTER USING PASSWORD â†’." At the bottom center of the page, include a small gray footer line linking to "Shopify" in underlined text. The overall font color scheme is various shades of gray with blue accent on the notify button.
