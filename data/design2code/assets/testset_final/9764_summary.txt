Create a centered, minimalist webpage with a white background and gray text. At the top center, display the site title in a serif font with spaced-out letters in bold. Below it, place a horizontal navigation menu with small, lowercase links separated by vertical lines. Centered beneath is a bold, slightly larger heading for the contact section, followed by a smaller descriptive text. Below, align a simple contact form with labels on the left and input fields on the right, including text inputs for name, email, subject, and a larger textarea for the message. Include a pale gray rectangular "Send" button aligned under the inputs to the left. At the very bottom center, add a small footer note in gray. Keep the layout narrow and vertically stacked with ample white space.
