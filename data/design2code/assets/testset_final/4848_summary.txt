Create a clean, professional webpage with a dark navy blue header bar at the top containing the logo "BIZ SET" in bold white and orange text on the left and a white "COLORADO A-Z" menu item on the right. Below the header, place a left vertical navigation panel with four white rectangular buttons labeled "General Information," "Description," "Map," and "Transactions," stacked with light gray backgrounds and subtle borders. The main content area on the right has a white background with distinct, lightly bordered rectangular sections spaced vertically. The top section is titled "General Information" in bold dark gray with a breadcrumb above in small orange and gray text. Inside it, display two columns of labeled data rows with orange icons next to bold field names on the left and details in smaller black text on the right. Below this is a "Description" section with a heading in bold dark gray and multi-line black text including several orange hyperlink phrases. Then display a large rectangular placeholder area with a "Loading..." text in the center, presumably for a map or graphic. Below that is a "Company transactions" table in a white box with a light gray header row and alternating row backgrounds; the columns have bold headings and details in dark gray text. Finally, add a smaller "Companies nearby" box with orange linked names and subtle horizontal lines separating them. The footer is a dark navy blue bar featuring a small “Contact us” line and privacy policy links in orange text, separated by a horizontal line from a copyright notice in gray. The overall font is a clean sans-serif style with black and dark gray text on white backgrounds, accented by orange highlights and icons.
