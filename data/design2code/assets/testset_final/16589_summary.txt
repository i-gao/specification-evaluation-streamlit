Create a webpage with a black top navigation bar containing white text on the left and three right-aligned navigation links, one highlighted with a black background and white text (Bug Patterns), and two others in gray text. Below, place a white content area with a large heading in dark gray and a subtitle in lighter gray. To the right of the heading, display a small label area with bold text in black and adjacent text in lighter black. The main content uses dark text and highlights specific keywords in small pink blocks with red text. Include two light gray code blocks with rounded corners containing monospaced text in black and keywords in green and teal, styled as multiline comments in italicized teal. Provide section headings in bold dark gray and normal text paragraphs below with certain parts highlighted as pink code-like blocks. The footer is a dark gray strip with small centered white text.
