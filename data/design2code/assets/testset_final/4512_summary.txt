Create a centered, narrow white content container on a light gray background. At the top is a gray-outlined box labeled "Description," containing smaller gray and black text paragraphs and three equally sized stacked rectangular images with bright blue fills (src 'rick.jpg'), evenly spaced vertically. Below is a thin horizontal divider line, followed by a black clickable link aligned left. Then, a small center-aligned light gray text "Advertisements" label. Under that, a series of white boxes with subtle gray borders stacked vertically: The first box is labeled "What's New" with a faint subtitle beneath. The second box labeled "Information" includes a two-row table with light gray labels on the left and bolder black details on the right, separated by a thin gray line, plus a clickable link beneath. Below this, a section of two more white boxes with thin gray borders containing left-aligned links. At the bottom, two small center-aligned text lines read "Terms and Conditions" and "Advertisements." Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout with black and gray text colors.
