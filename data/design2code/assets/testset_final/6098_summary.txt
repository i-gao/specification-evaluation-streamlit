Create a dark gray webpage background with a bold red horizontal header bar at the top containing the site name in white, bold, uppercase font on the left, and navigation links aligned on the right in small white text. Below, place a medium gray rounded rectangle box on the left side with centered white and light gray text, including an italicized heading and smaller detail text below it. Inside this box, include a blue rectangular image placeholder. To the right, add a larger blue rectangular image placeholder with a thin white border. Under this large image, place text with a white "About" label in bold, followed by italicized gray text and smaller, lighter gray descriptive text below. Finally, add a horizontal rule and a footer row with lighter gray text aligned left and right, including subtle social media or share icons in gray. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
