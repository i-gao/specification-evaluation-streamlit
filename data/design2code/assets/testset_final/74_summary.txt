Create a webpage with a dark blue background and a large white centered container. At the top right inside the blue background, place three white text links spaced evenly horizontally. Inside the white container, center a blue text headline near the top. Below that, on the left side, include a light blue rounded rectangle block with a small dark blue square image above it and inside it place a large dark blue rectangular image near the top, a smaller rectangular dark blue button centered near the bottom, and black and gray text content between the images. To the right of the light blue block, add a vertical section with bold black headings and smaller black descriptive text, each paired with dark blue square or rectangular images aligned to the left. Separate the sections with a thin horizontal gray line. The footer below the white container should be black with a small blue square image on the left and multiple lines of small white text with some underlined links in the center. On the right side of the footer, separated by a thin vertical blue line, show three columns with small blue square icons aligned left and white text to the right in each. The layout uses a clean sans-serif font throughout.
