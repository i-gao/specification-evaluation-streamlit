Create a clean blog webpage with a white header containing the blog title aligned left in bold black text and a small italicized subtitle below it. Place a green search link aligned right in the header. Below the header, add a wide teal-green banner spanning the page width with a large, bold white headline text left-aligned. Under the banner, present the blog post date in small grey text followed by the article body in black with some teal-green hyperlinks. Include a green "SHARE" label on the right side of the article text. Further down, show a section titled "Popular posts from this blog" in small bold grey text, followed by three separate blog summary entries aligned vertically with teal-green bold headlines, dates in grey, summary text in black, and green "SHARE" and "READ MORE" links underneath. Place a black square image placeholder to the right of the second post's summary. At the page bottom center, add small green "Powered by Blogger" text and a copyright notice in tiny grey font. Use a simple serif font for body text and a sans-serif font for headings. Keep the overall layout minimal and aligned left except for the search and share elements aligned right.
