Create a webpage layout with a bright red horizontal navigation bar at the top containing four text links spaced evenly: "Welcome," "Menu," "About Us," and "Location." The "About Us" tab should be highlighted with a light gray background. Below the navigation bar, place a white content area with a subtle shadow for depth. On the left sidebar, include a small section titled "More About Us" in black text with two red links below it, each followed by a black dot. The main content area on the right features a bold, blue, left-aligned heading and a thin red horizontal line beneath it. Below the heading, add paragraphs of black body text aligned left. On the right side of these paragraphs, place a rectangular blue image representing 'rick.jpg.' At the bottom of the page, add a horizontal red line spanning the content width, with a centered footer containing red text links separated by red vertical bars, and a copyright line in black with a red link included. Use clean, sans-serif fonts throughout.
