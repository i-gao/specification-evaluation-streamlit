Create a website layout with a dark gray top bar containing right-aligned white navigation links and a rounded dark gray search input on the far right. Below that, place a medium gray horizontal bar with a bright blue rectangular logo aligned left and bold white navigation links aligned right. Centered underneath is a large light gray section with a white content block on the left containing a bold black heading and black paragraph text, plus a bold dark pink link. On the right side within the light gray area, include a white sidebar with a light blue top border, a bold black heading, and black vertical navigation links. The footer is dark gray with four white text columns horizontally arranged, each with a bold heading and smaller links below, plus a bottom bar with a small bright blue rectangle logo on the left, copyright text next to it, and right-aligned small white bold footer links. Use clean, sans-serif fonts and maintain consistent spacing horizontally and vertically.
