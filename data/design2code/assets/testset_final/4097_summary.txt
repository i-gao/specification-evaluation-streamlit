Create a clean webpage with a light blue header section containing the site title "The Blinds Company" aligned left in a tall, thin, elegant font with an underline, and "CF15" aligned right in a larger size of the same font. Below this, a horizontal menu bar with four small light blue buttons labeled for categories. The main content area has a white background with a dark gray headline and body text in a simple sans-serif font. There are two bold orange call-to-action bars with black text and partially bolded phrases in the center. Display a grid of two rows and five columns of medium-sized, bright blue square images (source 'rick.jpg') each with a small white caption box beneath describing different types of blinds. Below the images, add a full-width light blue bar with bold black text centered. At the bottom, include a light blue footer with small gray text centered, and below it, a very narrow footer with smaller dark gray text containing copyright and links arranged horizontally. The overall layout is centered and balanced, with consistent spacing and alignment.
