Create a webpage with a vertical gradient background transitioning from pale yellow at the top to light green near the navigation bar. At the top, include a horizontal navigation bar with a light yellow-green gradient background containing four evenly spaced bold black links labeled "Software," "Services," "Blog," and "Store." Below the navigation, center a large bright blue rectangular image with the source set to 'rick.jpg', followed by a short centered text line in standard black font. Underneath, present three equal-width columns horizontally aligned, each with a green bold heading, a thin vertical light green border separating them, and a small green description text beneath each heading. Below that section, align two columns: the left column titled "Blog" in bold green with a list of green links and dates aligned right in a smaller black font, and the right column titled "Contact" in bold green with a vertical list of green links. At the bottom, place a footer with four columns of green links and a small green horizontal line above a centered copyright note in gray with a final green link and bold text. Use a clean serif font for headings and a simple serif or sans-serif font for smaller text throughout. Ensure all text and elements have sufficient spacing for readability.
