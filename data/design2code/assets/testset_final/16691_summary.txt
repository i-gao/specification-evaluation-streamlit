Create a clean, minimalistic blog layout on a light gray (#FAFAFA) background. At the top left, place a bold, uppercase header in a large sans-serif font, colored bright orange (#E94E1B). Below that, a horizontal navigation menu with small gray uppercase text and spacing between the links. Under the menu, have a bold article title in black, followed by a small gray date text. Then include a large bright blue rectangular image (use 'rick.jpg') centered with margins. Below the image, add italicized subheading text in dark gray, followed by multi-paragraph body text in a serif font, dark gray, justified left, with some embedded blue hyperlink text. Further down, embed a smaller bright blue square image (use 'rick.jpg') aligned center. Include a small "Subscribe" button below the image. At the bottom, separate the footer with a thin gray horizontal line, and beneath it, place small gray text on the left and blue links on the right in a small serif font. The entire layout is vertically centered with generous white space on sides, using consistent spacing and a clean, readable type hierarchy.
