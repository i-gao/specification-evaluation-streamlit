Please create a clean, white background webpage layout with a dark top navigation bar in black (#222). The top nav includes a left-aligned "ReactXP" logo in bright green, followed by navigation menu items "Docs," "Community," "Versions," and "Blog" in light gray or white text, with "Docs" highlighted in black background and a subtle green underline. On the far right of the nav bar is a "GitHub" link in white. Below the nav, the main content is split into two columns: a narrow left sidebar with section headings in bold uppercase black text and their corresponding links in smaller gray text, separated by light gray horizontal rules; and a larger right content area with the main heading "REST Client" in dark gray and subheadings slightly lighter gray, paragraphs in medium dark gray, and embedded code blocks in a light beige background with monospace font in multiple colors for syntax highlighting. The code block's header uses a pale beige background with "Code" label in light brown. The bottom right of the content has a small bright green "Next â†’" link aligned right. The footer is a dark charcoal gray with white text links arranged in two columns: left column with "Docs," "Blog," and "Community," right column with "GitHub," "React," and "React Native," and a centered copyright line below in medium gray. Use simple sans-serif fonts throughout and maintain clean spacing.
