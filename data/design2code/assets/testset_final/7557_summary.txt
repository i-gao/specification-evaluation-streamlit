Please create a web page with a muted light blue-gray background and a white content area aligned to the left containing the main text. At the top and bottom, include a horizontal navigation bar in a slightly darker blue-gray with black bold "Navigation" text centered. Inside the content area, place a large bold blue heading followed by black paragraph text and a nested bulleted list with orange links. To the right, have a white sidebar with multiple sections separated by light blue-gray headers with white bold text, containing orange links and a search box with a Go button. Use a clean serif font for the body text and a sans-serif font for headings, keeping the color palette consistent with dark blue for main links and orange for secondary links.
