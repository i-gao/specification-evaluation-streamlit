Create a clean, professional web layout with a white background and a fixed top navigation bar containing a multicolor logo on the left ("DATA" in blue, "GOV" in red, and "US" in bold red), followed by horizontal menu items in gray text with dropdown arrows ("Business," "Employee," "New York," "Los Angeles"), and a search box with a white input field and a "Go" button on the right. Below, on the left side, include a light gray bordered sidebar with two stacked input search boxes and "Go" buttons for location-restricted searches. The main content area to the right features a large bold black heading and a lighter subheading below it, followed by a horizontal breadcrumb navigation with small blue links on a light gray background bar. Below that, place a large white content box for an image placeholder. Beneath the image, add a descriptive paragraph in standard black text, with some text in blue links. Then, include two light gray tables with subtle borders and headers: one with a bold title row and data rows with bold labels on the left and text or blue links on the right; and two narrower tables below it, each with a gray header row and alternating rows listing linked business names on the left in blue and addresses on the right in black text. Finally, a light gray footer at the bottom contains small blue links horizontally aligned. Use a simple, readable sans-serif font and maintain consistent spacing and alignment throughout.
