Create a webpage layout with a light gray background and a central white content area. At the top, include a large rectangular blue hero section with an image (src set to 'rick.jpg') covering most of its area. Overlapping the top-left corner of this blue area, place a horizontal blue banner containing white bold uppercase text. Below the hero section, present a clean content area with black and gray text, using a mix of bold headings and regular paragraph fonts in a serif style. Include a light gray blockquote with a vertical blue line on the left and some inline code elements styled with light backgrounds and monospace font within the text. The overall alignment is centered with moderate margins on the sides.
