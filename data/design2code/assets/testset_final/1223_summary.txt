Create a clean and simple webpage layout on a white background with centered black text at the top reading "PRO Fitness" and "Happy Thanksgiving!" below it. Below that, center a bold heading "Thanksgiving Week Hours" with smaller left-aligned subheading "Hours" and a bullet list with four items in light gray and bold styling on some lines. Beneath the list, place a wide, bright blue rectangular image with the source set to 'rick.jpg' spanning about 70% width, centered horizontally. Below the image, center a small black label "Little Pros." Next, have two columns side by side: on the left a "Little Pros" heading in black with multiple paragraphs and bolded labels in each paragraph, and on the right a "Hours" heading with smaller text and italicized subheadings for days and hours in normal black font. A thin black footer line with left-aligned copyright text and right-aligned "Powered by GoDaddy" link below everything. Include a teal cookie consent box with black "Accept" button fixed in the top-right area overlapping content. The font is a clean sans-serif throughout.
