Please create a web layout with three horizontally aligned rectangular sections at the top: a large blue rectangular image on the left, a smaller blue rectangular image in the middle, and a narrow red vertical rectangle on the right. Below these images, include a series of content sections with dark gray horizontal bars containing white bold text as headings, followed by descriptive text in smaller black font. Include two red rectangular buttons with white bold text aligned vertically in the cause section, accompanied by explanatory text on their right side. At the bottom, add a light gray footer containing several small blue square icons spaced evenly and text links in smaller font. The overall layout should use simple fonts and maintain clear separation between sections with consistent spacing. Use the image source 'rick.jpg' for the blue rectangles.
