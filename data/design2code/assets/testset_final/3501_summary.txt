Create a webpage with a white background for the upper section and a dark gray footer at the bottom. At the top left, place small "blog" and "Contact" text links. Below that on the left, include a rectangular bright blue image (src='rick.jpg'). Centered horizontally next to the image, show a bold, navy blue address line, and to its right, a bold navy blue phone contact in brackets. Below this top section, have a horizontal navigation menu with bold black text links spaced evenly: HOME, PRINTING SERVICES, MAILING SERVICES, PROMOTIONAL ITEMS.

Underneath, arrange four columns of text content in dark gray. The left two columns primarily contain address and directions text with left alignment, the third column includes bold labels with contact info in black, and the fourth column to the right includes three smaller bright blue squares spaced horizontally and a light gray speech bubble with dark gray text below them. The speech bubble has a small pointed tail on the left bottom side.

In the footer (dark charcoal background), place a left-aligned dark gray speech bubble containing white testimonial text and a bold white name label underneath. Next to it, have two paragraphs of white quote text with small italicized author names. To the right, arrange four bright blue squares forming a 2x2 grid with a 1px black border, and further right, place a contact form with tiny white labels for "Name" and "E-mail" stacked vertically and two small rectangular buttons for "Send Message" and "Clear Form" side by side. At the very bottom center, include a small, light gray copyright line. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
