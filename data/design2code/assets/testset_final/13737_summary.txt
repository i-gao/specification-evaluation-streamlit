Create a dark-themed webpage with a very dark gray background. At the top left, place the site name text in white and to the right three navigation links "Home," "Our History," and "Charter," with the "Home" link highlighted in white with a white underline and the others in gray. Centered beneath that, include a main heading in white with a medium-large font, followed by two lines of white body text, all center-aligned. Below this text, add a smaller centered label in white. Then display five horizontally spaced white rounded rectangular buttons, each containing a small bright blue square image on the left followed by black text on the right. The buttons should have some spacing between them and be horizontally centered. The blue squares represent images with src set to "rick.jpg." Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
