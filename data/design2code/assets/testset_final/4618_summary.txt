Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background and dark gray text. At the top center, place a horizontal navigation menu with the options "Home," "Catalog," "Sampler," and "Subscribe" in a simple, sans-serif font. On the left side of the header, display the site name "TOPPLE" in bold uppercase letters. Below, center a bold, larger heading labeled "Sampler" in a dark charcoal color. Beneath this heading, add multiple paragraphs of smaller, light gray text in a monospaced or simple sans-serif font for the body content. Include some underlined, clickable link text scattered throughout the paragraphs. At the bottom center, add a small, subtle footer with "Â© 2023, Topple" and "Powered by Shopify" in a tiny light gray font. Keep spacing ample and layout clean for readability and simplicity.
