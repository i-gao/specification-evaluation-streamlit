Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a white background. At the top center is a medium blue square image (src 'rick.jpg') above a bold, dark navy blue heading in a sans-serif font. Below the heading, add a small, light gray subtitle. On the left side, display a vertical navigation list with nested sub-items in varying shades of gray with small arrow icons before each link, indented according to hierarchy. On the right side, place the main content area featuring a bold dark navy blue subheading and a smaller gray date below it. Below that is a paragraph of black body text with a blockquote styled background in very light gray and a thin vertical blue line on the left. Finally, center a small gray copyright notice at the bottom of the content area. Use consistent spacing and alignment for a balanced, minimalistic design.
