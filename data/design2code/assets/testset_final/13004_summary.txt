A clean, minimalist webpage layout with a white background and centered content. At the top is a header with a small bright blue square image on the left (src set to 'rick.jpg'), a horizontal navigation menu in medium gray text centered with items spaced evenly, and a right-aligned purchase summary in the same gray. Below the header is a centered large heading in bold black text with spaced letters. The main content area is a left-aligned FAQ section with bold subheadings and normal weight body text in black, arranged in paragraphs with clear spacing. At the bottom is a light gray footer with small, evenly spaced links aligned to the right. The overall font is a clean sans-serif with consistent spacing and alignment.
