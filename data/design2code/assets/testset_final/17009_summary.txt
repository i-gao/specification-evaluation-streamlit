Create a webpage with a light blue header containing a left-aligned blue square image (src='rick.jpg') next to dark gray text including a bold hotel name and address info. On the right side of the header, place a reservation form with a "RESERVATION" label and input fields for Check-In, Check-Out dates, Adult, and Child counts, each in small boxes with a light beige background and borders. Below the header, add a dark navy horizontal navigation bar with white bold links: Home, Reservation, Amenities, Things to do. Under that, include a large bright blue rectangular hero image (src='rick.jpg') spanning the content width. Below the hero, create three adjacent bordered white boxes with orange headings labeled "Room Amenities," "Hotel Amenities," and "Local Favorites." Each box has bullet points in small navy text and a small blue square image (src='rick.jpg') aligned to the right side inside the box. Then display a section with a navy subheading and multiple paragraphs of small black and orange text giving location directions, followed by a section with an orange bold label "Get Driving Direction:" with a wide rectangular input field and a right-aligned orange button labeled "Get directions." Finally, create a full-width dark navy footer with three columns of white text: left column "Hotel Details" in bold with check-in/out times, center column "Quick Links" in bold with bulleted navigation links, right column "Contact Us" in bold orange hotel name and address lines, phone, fax, email. Below that three small blue square icons (src='rick.jpg') horizontally aligned, followed by centered white copyright and site credit text. Use consistent fonts with small, bold headings in orange or navy, and keep overall spacing balanced.
