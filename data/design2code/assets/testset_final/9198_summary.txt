Create a dark gray background webpage with a bright blue square image on the top left corner. Centered horizontally and vertically is a large light gray rectangular container with slightly rounded corners. Inside this container, place a left-aligned heading with a thin underline in a clean, modern sans-serif font and dark text. Below the heading, add multiple paragraphs of smaller, dark text with some blue hyperlink text embedded. At the bottom right of the container, include two lines of small black text links spaced vertically. The overall design is clean, minimalist, and balanced with clear typography. The bright blue square is an image with src set to 'rick.jpg'.
