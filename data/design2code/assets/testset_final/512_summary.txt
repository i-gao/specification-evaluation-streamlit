Please create a webpage with a dark navy horizontal top navigation bar containing a bright blue square on the left with orange text over it labeled "Toolkit." To the right on the navbar, include several white text links spaced evenly, and a round white button with a small blue square inside near the right end, followed by a white hamburger menu icon. Below the navbar on the left, place a vertical white sidebar with a subtle drop shadow containing a version selector dropdown and a vertical list of blue links with some links in darker blue. On the main content area, center a large heading with "Module" in dark navy and "Ot_drawer" in bright blue. To the right of this heading, include a toggle switch styled as a blue slider with gray text below it. Below that, show two horizontally stacked code blocks with a light beige background and a faint watermark text, using monospace font and multiple text colors for syntax highlighting (green, purple, blue, pink). Beneath the code blocks, provide multi-line black and blue text paragraphs explaining the code. On the far right side, place a circular orange button with white text inside it labeled "Switch to Reason syntax." The layout should be clean with ample white space and a modern sans-serif font.
