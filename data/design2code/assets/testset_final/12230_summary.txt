Create a clean, minimalist webpage layout with a white background and dark green headers. Use bolded dark green for main title and subheadings in progressively smaller font sizes. Include a short paragraph below the main header, followed by specifications in a two-column format with bold labels on the left and normal text on the right. Below that, have a "Clients" section with a brief line of text and a bulleted list. Next, add a "Missing Links" section with italic and bold text at the start, followed by another bulleted list. At the bottom, place a full-width thin horizontal line, and below that, a small, faint copyright and licensing text in multiple lines with left alignment. Use a serif font for all text.
