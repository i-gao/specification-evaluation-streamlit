Create a web page layout with a blue gradient horizontal header bar at the top containing white text aligned left. Below that, add a breadcrumb navigation in smaller blue text with links and a dark gray arrow separator. The main content area is divided into two columns: a wider left column with a white background containing a heading in large black font, a paragraph in smaller black font, followed by a white content box with a subtle drop shadow and a light blue numbered circle icon on the left. The box includes bold subheading text and a date in bold, with a block of descriptive text below. Below that is a light blue box with a thin border containing a smaller heading and a table listing problem categories in blue links in the left column and light blue bars with numeric values in the right column. The narrower right column has two dropdown selectors with labels in black text and blue dropdown menus, plus two blue links with small green and blue decorative icons. At the bottom, a full-width blue gradient footer bar with white text includes left-aligned copyright info and right-aligned secondary navigation links, plus a horizontal menu of links below aligned left. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout, gentle shading and spacing for clarity, and consistent blue tones for links and interface elements.
