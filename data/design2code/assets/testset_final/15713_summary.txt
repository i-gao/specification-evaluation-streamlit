Create a clean, white background webpage with a dark red horizontal header bar at the top containing a small blue square image on the left and white text reading "INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON" aligned to the right of the image. Below the header, have a large blue uppercase letter-spaced heading "WYLIE HOUSE EXHIBITS" aligned left, with a search input field and small dark blue button aligned to the right on the same horizontal line. Under that, place a horizontal navigation menu with four gray tabs labeled "Home," "Exhibits," "Virtual Tour," and "Finding Aids." Below the nav, show a breadcrumb line in small gray text. The main content area includes a large uppercase blue heading with letter spacing, followed by two blue rectangular images: a larger square image floated left and a smaller rectangular image floated right, with a block of black body text wrapping between and around the images. Beneath this is a horizontal line, followed by smaller black paragraph text and a bullet list. At the bottom, place a thin dark red footer bar with a small blue square image on the left, red links in small text aligned left, and black text aligned right. The font throughout should be clean and sans-serif, with blue used for main headings and red for footer links.
