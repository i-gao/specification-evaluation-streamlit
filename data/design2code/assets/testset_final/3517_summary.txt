Create a clean, minimalistic webpage layout with a white background and gray text. At the top, include a horizontal navigation bar with three textual links aligned left ("Apps" with a dropdown arrow), right-aligned links "Support" (highlighted with a light gray background) and "Contact," using a simple sans-serif font in medium gray. Below, place a small horizontal menu with two text links aligned left ("Projects 2 Support") and a medium blue rectangular button labeled "Privacy Policy" to the right of it. Below that, add a thin gray horizontal line. On the main content area, align a small, bright blue square image to the left side next to the page title "Projects 2 Privacy Policy" in a larger, dark gray sans-serif font. Under the title, include distinct black headings and smaller gray body text paragraphs describing the privacy policy. At the bottom, add a full-width thin gray horizontal line above a cookie consent message in black aligned left with a link and a white rectangular "Agree and Close" button with bold black text and black border aligned right. Lastly, include a footer with two columns of text links ("Apps" and "Support") in small gray font, and a smaller copyright disclaimer line centered below in gray.
