Create a clean, minimalistic webpage layout with a white background and black text. At the top, have a small grey navigation bar with left-aligned text "Ship Globally | Posted within 24 hours" and right-aligned links: "Log in", "or", "Create account", a cart icon, and a search text link. Center below that is the page title in a large, bold, dark grey font: "Zoetrope Animations & Praxinoscope" with a thin grey horizontal line underneath. Below that, place a horizontal navigation menu with links: "Home", bold "About Us", "Zoetrope", and "Praxinoscope" in small dark grey font with subtle separators. The main content area features a bold "About Us" heading on the left and multiple paragraphs of black text in regular font, aligned left, with some bolded words in the body. Under the text, include a large bright blue rectangular image spanning about 40% vertical space. Below the image left-aligned is a line of small text with a red hyperlink. The footer area includes five columns: "Latest News" and related text in small font on the left, "Quick Links," "Follow Us" with social icons in the center, "Contact Us" text in small font, and a "Newsletter" signup form with a white email input box and a coral-red "Subscribe" button on the right. At the very bottom is a black horizontal row of four evenly spaced black squares and a small grey copyright line below that, center-aligned. The overall font is a clean sans serif with a modern, straightforward style.
