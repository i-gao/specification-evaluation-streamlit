Create a clean, grid-based web layout with a purple top navigation bar containing three white text links evenly spaced: "Create," "Explore," and "Ideas." Below, on a light gray-blue background, place a left sidebar consisting of a bold dark gray studio title, a large square image below it using 'rick.jpg', and beneath that a light blue info box with centered text. Show two small blue legend indicators with text below that box. To the right, display four horizontally aligned pill-shaped filter buttons with rounded corners, each a different shade of gray or purple, with the first button fully purple and the rest light gray with gray text. Below that, have a dark gray "Projects" header and a grid of multiple rectangular images (src 'rick.jpg'), each with a smaller thumbnail image in the bottom-left corner, followed by bold blue project titles and smaller gray user names. The grid should have consistent spacing across four columns and multiple rows. At the bottom, include a wide purple button with white, bold "Load More" text. The footer below is on a pale gray background with six columns of small purple and gray text links aligned horizontally in distinct categories, and a small centered search input below all columns. The fonts throughout are clean sans-serif with a consistent, modern style.
