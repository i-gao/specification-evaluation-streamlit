Create a webpage layout with a dark gray background (#181818). At the top left, place the site title in bold white font, followed by a smaller, light gray subtitle beneath it. Below that, center a light pink rectangular content container with a blog post title in bold dark gray font near the top left, and a date in smaller gray text underneath. Below the date, center a blue rectangular image with the src set to 'rick.jpg'. Under the image, place a small line of text with a pink hyperlink. Below that, separate the comments section with a dotted line and list user comments vertically, each with a small blue circular avatar on the left, user names in pink font, and comment text in black, with times in smaller gray font. At the bottom left inside the container, add a pink "Post a Comment" link. Finally, place a small footer centered at the bottom of the page with white text. Use clean, readable fonts consistent throughout.
