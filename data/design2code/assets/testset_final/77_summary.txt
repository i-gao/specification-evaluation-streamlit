Create a webpage with a bright blue header spanning the top containing the site title in large, bold, light gray text with subtle black shadowing. Below the header, horizontally center a series of fuchsia pink rounded square buttons with bold white letters from A to Z separated by small spaces and placed above a thin gray horizontal line. The page background should be light gray. Below the navigation buttons, display a bright pink bold heading followed by black descriptive text paragraphs with a standard readable font and normal weight. Near the bottom, place a horizontal bright blue footer spanning the width with small white text including a line of white text and a single word in small pinkish-red font. Within the footer center a small bright blue rectangular button shape. The layout is clean and spaced with ample margins around text blocks.
