Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a white background. At the top center, place a large, bold, dark gray heading reading "Autocomplete Jokes." Below the heading, stack four light gray rectangular cards vertically, each containing a bold timestamp in dark gray at the top left and a black joke text underneath in a regular font. Each card should have subtle drop shadows for a slight 3D effect and consistent spacing around them. At the bottom center, include a pagination bar with the numbers "6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0" in medium gray, spaced evenly and separated by vertical bars. Use a clean sans-serif font overall.
