Create a clean, elegant webpage with a black top navigation bar containing white uppercase text links spaced evenly: HOME, COCKTAILS, FOODS, EXTRAS. Below that, a dark charcoal gray header section centered horizontally, featuring a large white serif font title and a smaller italicized line beneath with a clickable link in blue. The main content area should have a very light off-white background with black text using a classic serif font. Include multiple sections with headings in a slightly larger serif font and bullet points for list items. Add subtle horizontal dotted line separators at the bottom above a small, centered footer with light gray italic text. The layout should be centered with generous white padding. Use a refined, readable style with consistent spacing.
