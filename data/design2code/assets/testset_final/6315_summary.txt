Create a clean, minimalistic webpage header with a white background. On the top left, place the text "Curious sound." in a simple black font. Centered horizontally at the top, include a small blue rectangular image with the source 'rick.jpg'. On the top right, add a green rounded rectangular "Subscribe" button with white text. Below, add a horizontal navigation menu with items "HOME," "RECORD," "CRUCIAL LISTENING," and "MASTERING," spaced evenly and using a simple black font on a white background with a subtle gray border line beneath.

Below that navigation, in the main content area on white background, display a section title in bold uppercase black text. Follow it with a large, bold headline in black, and a smaller paragraph in a lighter black/gray shade. Underneath, include two article summaries each with a bold subheading and smaller descriptive text, all left-aligned. Each article summary includes a muted gray metadata line below.

Finally, include a dark gray footer with centered white text for the subscription call-to-action headline in bold large font, a smaller subtitle below it, and a white rounded "Subscribe now" button beneath. Below this button, include two thin horizontal lines with small white text "Sign up" between them, and at the very bottom a smaller light gray copyright text line. The overall font is clean and modern, with liberal whitespace and consistent alignment.
