Create a clean, minimal two-column layout on a white background. The left column has black text aligned left with the headings "Stream Farm" in bold, then "Dallington" normal, and "Bed & Breakfast" below in a smaller font, all in a simple sans-serif font. The right column starts with a paragraph of black, regular-weight sans-serif text describing location details, aligned left. Below that is a light gray rectangular box with a subtle border, inside which is a smaller bright blue rectangle centered horizontally and vertically as an image placeholder. At the very bottom center of the page, include small gray text lines for the address and contact info, followed by even smaller lighter gray disclaimers and a copyright notice aligned left. The design uses consistent spacing and a neat, professional font style throughout.
