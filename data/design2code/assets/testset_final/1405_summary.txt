Create a clean web page with a large blue header area at the top containing an image with src 'rick.jpg'. Below the header is a horizontal red navigation bar with white bold text links spaced evenly: Home, Blog, Categories, About. The main content area beneath is white with black text, featuring a breadcrumb line, followed by a large bold heading in black and a smaller paragraph description in black. Below that, display product cards in a grid of three rows: the first two rows have four cards each, the last row has one card, each card with a small blue image (src 'rick.jpg') on top, product source text in small grey font, and product name below in black. On the right side is a vertical sidebar with a white background containing a rounded search input field at top, then a categories section with a dark blue background header and white bold text, category items in black on a light grey background. Below is a "What's New" section with the same styling, including bold white headers and multiple bold black links on a light grey background. At the bottom right is a small informational box with grey background and black text. The page footer is black with small white text and a grey link. The overall font is clean and sans-serif.
