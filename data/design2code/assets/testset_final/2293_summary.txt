Create a clean login form centered horizontally on a white background beneath a wide, horizontal dark blue header bar at the top. The header bar contains left-aligned bold white text. Below the header, place a short instruction line of standard black text aligned left with the form below it. The form itself is in the center and includes two labeled input fields side by side: a black-outlined text box for "Email or phone" and a light gray-outlined text box for "Password." Below these input fields, add a blue rectangular login button with white text, a small blue hyperlink below it left-aligned under the button, and a green rectangular "Create new account" button with white bold text beneath that. Use a simple, sans-serif font for all text elements.
