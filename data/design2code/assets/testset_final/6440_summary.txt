Create a minimalistic coming soon page with a white background and center-aligned content. Use a clean sans-serif font in medium gray for the text. Place a navigation button labeled "ENTER USING PASSWORD â†’" in the top right corner with uppercase, bold text and a subtle border. Center the main heading in bold, larger font with the subheading "COMING SOON" below it in smaller uppercase letters, both in medium gray. Below that, include a line of smaller gray text reading "Currently closed," followed by a bold prompt for email notification. Add a horizontal email input field with a white background and a blue-gray "NOTIFY ME" button aligned to the right in uppercase bold white text. Beneath this, center a bold "Spread the word" label and include three small, white rectangular social sharing buttons labeled "SHARE," "TWEET," and "PIN IT" with subtle borders and uppercase bold text spaced evenly. At the bottom, place a small gray copyright line with a clickable "Shopify" link in underline style.
