Create a webpage layout with a clean, light gray background and a central container with a white content area. At the top left inside the container, place a medium blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg'), aligned vertically with a vertical navigation menu below it on a pale yellow background for the selected item, light gray for others, and small orange accent bars on selected links. The navigation menu includes "Home," "About," and "Wiki." To the right of the navigation and image, place a large bright blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg'), spanning the full height of the navigation menu area. Below, create a content section with a bold heading in dark gray, a highlighted paragraph in pale yellow with black text, followed by multiple paragraphs of black body text on white background. On the left side below the navigation, add a "Site search" label with a plain white text input under it. Below the search, list small, blue hyperlink text items aligned vertically with minimal spacing. Use a simple, sans-serif font with normal weight for body text and bold for headings.
