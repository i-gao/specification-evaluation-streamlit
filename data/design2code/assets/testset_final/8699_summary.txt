Create a webpage header with a bright blue square image on the left labeled 'rick.jpg.' To the right of this image, display the site name "Richard Kissen & Associates" in two lines using a large serif font in black. Below the header, include a horizontal black navigation bar with white text menu items: HOME, ABOUT, SERVICES, RESOURCES, evenly spaced. Underneath, create a two-column layout: left column with black bold heading and multiple paragraphs of left-aligned black text in a clean sans-serif font, and the right column containing a large bright blue rectangular image also using 'rick.jpg' as the source. The background should be white overall.
