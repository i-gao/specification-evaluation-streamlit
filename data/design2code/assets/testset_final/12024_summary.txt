Create a clean, minimalistic e-commerce layout with a white background. Center a rectangular header image at the top, followed by a thin horizontal divider line. Below, use a two-column grid: a left sidebar with a small rectangular cart summary box outlined in aqua, with aqua text inside, followed by two sections of menu links in gray text and aqua section titles in bold serif font. On the right, place a large horizontal image slider with dark blue images that have navigation dots beneath. Below the slider, add a section titled "Featured Products" in bold aqua serif font, with a grid of four product blocks (three in one row, one below aligned left), each containing a dark blue product image, a product title in aqua serif font, and a price in small gray text below. The fourth product's image has a small "SOLD OUT" tag in white on a gray background in the top right corner. At the bottom, add a light gray horizontal footer with small, subtle copyright text in gray. Use serif fonts for headings and clean, simple sans-serif for other text.
