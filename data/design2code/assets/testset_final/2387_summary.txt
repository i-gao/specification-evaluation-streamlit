Create a clean, modern webpage layout with a dark header area containing a logo on the left and a horizontal navigation menu with four text links spaced evenly on the right. Below the header, include a large full-width image slider with dark overlay and left-aligned text in gray, plus pagination dots centered beneath the text. On a white background, add a row of three medium-sized rectangular images (src 'rick.jpg') evenly spaced horizontally with descriptive text below each. Below these images, center a small rounded button labeled "MORE NEWS" with a thin border. Further down, add a "Recent Projects" section title aligned left with a subtle horizontal line underneath. Below this, display another row of three rectangular images (src 'rick.jpg') with text captions beneath, spaced evenly. At the bottom center, include another small rounded button labeled "MORE PROJECTS" with a thin border. The footer has light gray text aligned left and right, on a white background with ample white space. Fonts should be clean and modern, with black or dark gray text on white and gray text on dark areas.
