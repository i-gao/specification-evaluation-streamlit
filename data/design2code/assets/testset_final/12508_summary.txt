Create a clean, minimalist blog layout on a white background with monospaced and serif fonts. Position the blog title in small uppercase letters near the top left, followed by the author name in a smaller, lighter monospaced font underneath. Below that, include a subtle link in the same font and color. Center a large, bold italic serif heading below, followed by multiple lines of monospaced paragraph text with key phrases in bold or underlined for emphasis. Include a small date line in lighter monospaced font under the text. At the bottom left, display the authorâ€™s name and contact details in small monospaced font, then below that a subtle horizontal list of navigation and social links, separated by hyphens, in a light gray color and monospaced font. The overall feel should be simple, text-focused, with a neutral gray tone for text elements on white background.
