Create a clean, simple web page with a dark green header banner at the top. The header contains white text aligned left reading "Selection Functions" and includes a subtle, darker green wave pattern. Below the header is a breadcrumb trail in small, olive green text on the left, and a "Help Contents" link in the same color on the right. The main body uses black text on white background, with bold section headings. A small table with a light gray header row is included, where the table content uses black text and some green links for function names. Under the footer, include small, faint gray text with copyright and version information. The layout is primarily textual, structured with clear spacing and minimal decoration.
