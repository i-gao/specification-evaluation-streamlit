Create a clean, white background web layout with a top navigation bar containing a small left-aligned blue square image (src='rick.jpg'), followed by a light blue link for navigation. Below that, place a large black header text horizontally aligned next to the blue image. Under the header, have a vertical stack of seven white rectangular cards with subtle gray borders and rounded corners, each containing a title in medium gray text and a smaller subtitle or description in light gray text below the title. The overall style should be minimalistic with a focus on readability and spacing.
