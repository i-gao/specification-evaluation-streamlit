Create a webpage with a soft pastel blue background and a central cream-colored content container with rounded corners. At the top-left, place the site title in a decorative gray font. Top-right has small "Log in" and "Sign up" links, a rounded currency selector in cream with a subtle shadow, and a mini shopping cart info in small black text to the right side. Below the header, a horizontal navigation bar with cream buttons and subtle rounded edges separated by thin vertical lines, containing links in a vintage blue script font. The main content area uses a soft cream background with a left vertical sidebar including a search box, stacked rounded cream menu buttons with vintage blue text (some with dropdown arrows), and small cream boxes containing "Stay in touch" colored round icons and a newsletter signup form with a rounded input and a blue oval subscribe button. To the right, a large blue rectangular image banner with white rounded corners above a centered italic welcome text in brownish-black. Below that, a section titled "Featured Products" in brown decorative font, with four evenly spaced product thumbnails (blue rectangles as images), each with product names and prices in small blue serif text. The footer below the content area has a horizontal row of small blue square icons centered above links in small black text and a tiny copyright line. The fonts are a combination of decorative vintage script for headings and clean serif for details.
