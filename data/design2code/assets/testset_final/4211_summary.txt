Please create a web layout with a clean white background and a small red timestamp text placed at the top left. The top section includes a large blue image placeholder on the left and a white search bar and shopping cart area on the right, aligned horizontally. Below that, a green horizontal navigation bar features menu items in white text evenly spaced. The main content area underneath uses a light cream background with a left sidebar of four vertically stacked small blue image placeholders and a wider blue image placeholder next to them. To the right of that, place a heading in medium blue text followed by bold black subtext lines. Include a small, outlined rectangular "Top" button on the far right side. Below, on a white background, there is a left sidebar in light gray containing customer quotes in purple text with black heading. To the right, arrange four product cards horizontally, each with a blue image on top and product details including bold black product names, pricing info, and a black "MORE INFO" button below. Further down, a large white content box displays black text headings and paragraphs with some blue clickable links. The footer area includes a wide blue image placeholder above a single line of small black footer links and copyright text centered, all on a white background. Use simple sans-serif fonts and keep spacing consistent for a clean and organized look.
