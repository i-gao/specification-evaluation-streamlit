Create a clean, white background webpage layout with a horizontal header containing two right-aligned images (250x100) side by side; the left image is larger, the right one smaller with caption text below. On the left vertical navigation area, display black text links in a simple sans-serif font with the active link in blue. The main content area to the right includes a green bold heading followed by black body text in a small sans-serif font. Insert two blue square images (150x150) aligned right and left within the text content. At the bottom, add a horizontally aligned row of four light blue text boxes with small black text and blue bold sub-headings. The footer features a small centered black text navigation with spaced links separated by vertical bars. Use consistent font styles and spacing for a neat, professional look.
