Create a webpage with a light beige background. Place a small rectangular blue image at the top left corner. Below and aligned left, add a large serif font headline in black, with smaller black text underneath it. Include a teal rectangular button with bold white text beneath the paragraph. On the right side, position a large square blue image (use 'rick.jpg' as the source). Keep the layout balanced with left-aligned text content and right-aligned large image.
