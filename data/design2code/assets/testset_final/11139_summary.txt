Create a web layout with a vertical left sidebar in a solid dark blue color containing a small square blue logo at the top left, followed by a vertically stacked menu of white and light blue text links aligned left, with the active link in bold white. To the right of the sidebar is a white main content area with subtle shadow or gradient from the sidebar edge for depth. At the top of this main area, place a heading in medium gray text, followed by breadcrumb-style blue links and a letter navigation using small blue clickable letters. Below that, present a light gray boxed info table with a left column of gray cells containing labels and a right column with white cells containing links and text. Under the box, show a multi-line preformatted text description in a monospace font with line breaks and indentation. Then, display a section labeled "Packages" containing four horizontally stacked rows, each with a small blue hyperlinked package name on the left and code or changelog text on the right in monospace font, separated by subtle borders. The entire layout uses clean, sans-serif fonts and a restrained color palette of dark blue, gray, black, and white for clarity and readability.
