Please create a webpage layout with a black top header bar containing a yellow "Login" link aligned to the right and a solid black rectangle area on the left side. Below that, include a breadcrumb navigation line with smaller blue text links spaced horizontally on a white background. Beneath the breadcrumb, place a main content area aligned left with a large blue rectangular image (src set to 'rick.jpg') below a black title in a large sans-serif font. Below the image, add multiple text sections with small blue link texts and black descriptive text in a clean, left-aligned format. On the right side of the main content, create a vertical sidebar with a light gray background featuring a search box with a black search button, radio button options in blue, and multiple stacked white buttons with black borders and dark gray header for grouping (like "This Collection"). Include a footer area with a light gray background containing a small blue rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg') to the left and black text to the right with links in blue, all in a small sans-serif font. The overall page background should be white with black and blue text elements.
