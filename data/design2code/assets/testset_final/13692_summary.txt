Create a clean, white background webpage with a top header containing a blue rectangular image on the left (src='rick.jpg'), a centered search input with a light gray border and placeholder text, and a right-aligned navigation with three simple black text links. Below the header, add a breadcrumb navigation in small teal uppercase text, followed by a main heading in black. Display multiple quotes as blue hyperlink text with the author name below in bold black and small gray rectangular tags beneath that in lighter gray, separated by thin light gray dividing lines. Include a simple pagination at the bottom with the current page number highlighted in a teal-filled square and other page numbers in small gray text. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout. At the very bottom, add a light gray footer with small black links aligned center, separated by vertical bars.
