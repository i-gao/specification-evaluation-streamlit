Request a webpage with a black top notification bar containing white text for a free webinar announcement. Below it, place a white header with a left-aligned blue logo text and a horizontal navigation menu on the right with black bold uppercase links, with the "TRAINING" link underlined. Next, include a full-width black section with center-aligned bright blue uppercase heading text and below that, blue paragraph text describing a product and a $199 price in white. Include a bright blue "BUY NOW!" button above a matching blue rectangular image placeholder. Beneath that, add smaller white text with bullet points in grey. After that, place a white section with a large bright blue uppercase heading centered at the top, followed by centered black body text with some bold headings and a bright blue "Show More" link. Below that, a bright blue rectangular call-to-action button. Then, a light grey full-width section with two columns, each containing a black heading above a large bright blue rectangular image placeholder, with bright blue rectangular buttons aligned below the images. Finally, a black footer with small white centered copyright text, a bold uppercase section label, and a small credit line in grey. Use consistent sans-serif fonts throughout for all text.
