Create a clean webpage layout with a light cream background. At the top center, include a bright blue rectangular image with the source 'rick.jpg'. Below this, have a wide white content area aligned left showing a bold, dark gray heading in a serif font, followed by smaller black paragraph text in a readable sans-serif font with standard line height and spacing. Inside this main content area, include a subtle bordered table with alternating light pink rows, containing red header text in the first column and blue bold links in the second column. On the right side of the page, add a narrow vertical sidebar with a very light off-white background, containing stacked textual navigation sections labeled "RESEARCH," "ARTICLES," and "RESOURCES." The "RESEARCH" and "ARTICLES" sections have sub-links in gray-blue text separated by thin horizontal lines. The side text uses a simple sans-serif font with section titles in bold or uppercase. At the bottom of the page, include a pale cream footer with small, center-aligned blue and gray text links and a copyright notice in a smaller font below.
