Create a clean, minimal web layout with a bright royal blue (#2A58E8) header spanning full width. Top left contains a small rectangular logo in solid royal blue. Top right corner has navigation links in small, white text aligned horizontally: "Free Trial," "Login," "3Dsellers Home," and "English." Below the header's right area, place a wide, rounded search bar in a lighter transparent overlay of the blue with white placeholder text. The main page background is white. Beneath the header, a breadcrumb line with small black and gray text is aligned left. Below that, embed a smaller royal blue square image (like the logo). The main content includes a bold black heading with smaller black subtext and a round blue user icon. Follow with multiple white rounded rectangular cards with subtle gray borders and shadow, each containing black headings and smaller gray subtext with spacing between cards. The footer uses white background with a small blue square logo in the center, above faint gray text links horizontally aligned: "The Ultimate eBay Selling Software," "Can't find the answer here?," "Youtube," and "Twitter." Below the links are three small blue squares horizontally centered, with a small gray tagline text underneath. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout with consistent spacing and subtle dividers separating content sections.
