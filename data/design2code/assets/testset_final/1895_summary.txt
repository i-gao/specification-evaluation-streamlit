Create a dark-themed blog layout with a black background. Use a bold crimson red for main headings, set in a large serif font, and smaller gray sans-serif text for paragraphs and captions. Place a horizontal gray line under the introductory subtitle near the top. Center a small italicized gray caption below the main content. At the bottom, position left- and right-aligned crimson red navigation links. Use clean spacing and left alignment for all text except the centered caption.
