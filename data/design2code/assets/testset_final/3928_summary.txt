Create a centered card with a dark gray background and rounded corners. At the top inside the card, add bold white text in a clean, sans-serif font. Below the text, place two horizontally aligned buttons stacked vertically with some spacing. The buttons should have a warm brown color, rounded edges, and white sans-serif text centered inside. Beneath the buttons, include a rectangular bright blue image area that fills the width of the card. The overall design should have a modern and clean look. Use the image source 'rick.jpg' for the blue image area.
