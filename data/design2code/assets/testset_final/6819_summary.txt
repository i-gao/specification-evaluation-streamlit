Create a page with a clean white background and a left sidebar with blue text links grouped under headings in small blue fonts. Centered on the page is a green rectangular navigation box with a subtle shadow, rounded corners, and white bold text header "Incel Forum Navbox." Inside, the box is divided into three rows and three columns with thin green borders separating cells. The left column text is blue, bold, and underlined, aligned right, and the right columns contain smaller colored text links: blue for regular links, red for special/moderator links, and purple for user status. The top row is the widest, with the header spanning across all columns in bold white text. The rest of the page has black body text in a simple sans-serif font, with a thin horizontal line under the main heading at top. Provide a small search bar and standard wiki navigation links aligned in the top right corner.
