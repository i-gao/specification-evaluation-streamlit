Create a clean, minimalist e-commerce product page layout with a white background and light gray top bar for search and user account links in small, gray font. Place a logo image on the left side of the header and a horizontal navigation menu on the right with simple text links spaced evenly. Below, display a breadcrumb navigation in small gray text above a large product image on the left with three smaller clickable thumbnails vertically aligned to its right. To the right of these, place the product title in a dark serif font with product price in teal below it and a small size selector input and a teal rectangular "Add to Cart" button underneath. Include product description text in small gray font below the purchase area. Below that, center a "Customer Reviews" heading in gray serif font with smaller review text beneath. Further down, present four product images aligned horizontally with short product titles and prices below each. The footer section uses a light gray background with five columns of text in dark gray, including a small image in the first column and a teal subscribe button in the newsletter column. Use consistent serif and sans-serif fonts in gray and teal accent colors throughout. All dark blue rectangles represent images with src set to 'rick.jpg'.
