Create a clean, minimalistic web layout with a white header containing a centered navigation menu of three text links in a muted red font; the middle link is outlined with a thin red rectangular border to highlight it. Below the header, place a large white section with black and muted red text aligned right, using a modern, sans-serif font, with the red text slightly larger and spaced out. Underneath is a black full-width section with centered white text in a clean sans-serif font. Include a small white downward arrow icon at the top center of this black section. Near the bottom center of the black section, add a wide muted red rectangular button with white uppercase text. The footer should be a narrow white bar with small black text left-aligned, including two small blue hyperlink texts in the middle. Finally, position a small bright blue square on the bottom right corner of the page.
