Create a clean, white-background webpage with a header aligned left reading "U+B0AF Hangul Syllable Nac" in a large serif font. Below the header on the left side, place a small label "Source: Noto CJK" in a subtle gray bubble. On the left side near the top, include a vertical list of key data with small labels in gray and values in bright red, using a small serif font. To the right and below that, place descriptive text in black with certain keywords in bright red as inline links, maintaining a classic serif font. Include indented italic paragraphs in black below the main text, using a smaller serif font. Centered below the text, show a "Representations" section with a small table of properties and values aligned center, with property names in bold black and values in black. Below that, add a left-aligned header "Elsewhere" with a bulleted list of red links. Further down, include a "Complete Record" section with a small two-column table showing property names in bold black and values in red or gray, centered horizontally. The overall layout uses black text on white with red highlights for links and key terms, all in classic serif fonts with careful spacing and indentation for paragraph text.
