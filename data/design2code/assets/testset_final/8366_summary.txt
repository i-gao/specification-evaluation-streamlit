Create a webpage with a white background main content area centered on a light gray page background. At the top left, place a small blue square image (src='rick.jpg'). To the right horizontally, add a navigation menu with four black text links underlined on hover: Home, Products, Hairstyles, Hair Tips. Below, a breadcrumb line in small black text shows "Home | Hair tips | What You Need to Know for Happy, Healthy Curls". Then a bold, uppercase black heading centered horizontally with letter spacing for the article title. Below, a byline with small text and thin vertical separators.

Under that, a large blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg') is left aligned with article text to the right. The article body uses black text in a clean sans serif font with bold subheadings. To the right side, a sidebar with a bold right-aligned maroon "Featured Posts" heading, a vertical list of links in black with underline on hover, and a bordered button with maroon text labeled "Curly Hair Posts". Beneath that, a list of categories with links in black and italic gray numbers aligned right.

The footer spans full width with a dark charcoal background. The footer content is divided into two columns with headings in bold white and underlined with a thin horizontal line. The left column labeled "Disclaimer" with smaller light gray text paragraphs, the right column labeled "Categories" with vertical lists of white links separated by thin lines. At the bottom right corner in small light gray text, place a copyright notice. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout.
