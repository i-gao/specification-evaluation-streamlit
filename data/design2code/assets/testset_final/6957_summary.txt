Create a clean webpage with a light gray background and a black header containing the site name aligned left and navigation links (Shop, Pages, cart summary) aligned right. Below, place product details on the left with bold headings and black text: a small "All products" label, product name in large bold font, description, italic price, quantity selector in a small outlined box, and a black-outlined "Add to Cart" button with quantity and price inside. On the right side, include a large bright blue rectangular image placeholder with the source set to "rick.jpg". Below everything, add a black footer bar with white text: copyright info on the left and a "Powered by" message on the right. Use simple, sans-serif fonts and a minimal layout with plenty of white space.
