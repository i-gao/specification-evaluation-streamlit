Create a centered web page layout with a dark slate gray background. At the top, place the website title in bold white text on the left, followed by navigation links (posts, search, subscribe, contact) in smaller gray font aligned horizontally to the right of the title. Below that, show a bold white heading for the article title, with a smaller light gray date line beneath it. Present the article content as white text paragraphs with bullet lists, with hyperlinks in subdued blue color for contrast. Separate content sections with a horizontal light gray rule. Below the article, display a bold white heading and additional instructions in smaller gray text. Include a large white rectangular comment input box with subtle rounded corners and placeholders. Below that, have three white input fields for name, email, and website in one row, each with subtle borders, followed by two small buttons ("Preview" and "Submit") aligned on the right. The footer at the very bottom is a single line of small, muted gray copyright text, centered horizontally. Use clean, sans-serif fonts consistent across the page.
