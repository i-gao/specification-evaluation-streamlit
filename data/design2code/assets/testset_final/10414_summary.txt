Create a full-screen split background with the left half in black and the right half in olive green. Centered vertically and horizontally in the screen, place a large bold white heading with a sans-serif font. Below the heading, add a smaller line of white text in a light, thin sans-serif font. The overall style is minimalistic and balanced with strong contrast between text and background.
