A clean, minimal white webpage layout with a light lavender background. At top, a wide search input box with placeholder text in light gray sits left, and a dark navy blue rectangular search button with no text is on the right. Below, a breadcrumb navigation line in light gray with one bright red link on the far left and the rest in muted gray. The center section is a large white card with subtle shadow containing teal bold headings, small gray text lines, and gray paragraphs describing content. Each content block includes a bright coral rectangular button labeled “Show More” or “Read More,” centered horizontally over the text. A subtle gray horizontal "Related" divider is placed midway with fine lines on both sides of the word. Below the card, a minimal footer area uses teal links for repeated article titles separated by very thin light gray lines. The bottom footer bar is pale gray with small dark gray text for privacy policy and other links aligned left. A small bright blue square logo sits left above the copyright text. The font is clean and modern with distinct weight differences for headings and details.
