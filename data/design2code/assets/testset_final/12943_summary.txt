The webpage layout features a clean, white background with small blue text links “PROJECTS” aligned left and “PROFILE” aligned right at the top. Centered beneath them is a medium-sized blue rectangular image with src 'rick.jpg'. Below this image is a centered headline in bold, medium blue serif font. Mid-page, a black horizontal cookie consent bar spans the full width with white text and a close (X) button on the right. Under the bar, left-aligned body text is in a small, light blue sans-serif font with ample white space around it. A thin horizontal blue line separates the descriptive text from a "CREDITS" section that uses bold blue monospace font for headings and regular monospace for details, arranged in two columns aligned left. Another thin horizontal blue line appears below the credits. Finally, a small blue square image with src 'rick.jpg' is centered near the bottom, followed by a centered footer with small black serif text and a muted copyright notice. The layout emphasizes blue tones on white with ample spacing and a minimalist design.
