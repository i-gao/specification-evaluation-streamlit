Create a webpage with a top white navigation bar featuring centered dark blue text links and a right-aligned green rectangular button with rounded corners. Below, include a wide dark navy blue section with large yellow serif font text centered horizontally. Underneath, add a bright blue horizontal banner with centered small white text. The main content area should have a white background and dark blue serif headings, with body text in dark blue sans-serif font. Include a green full-width section containing a left-aligned bright blue square image and right-aligned dark blue text in sans-serif font. Adjacent to this section, place a vertical light blue rectangular block aligned to the right with centered white serif headings and smaller white body text. Below, add a full-width orange section with centered white serif and bold sans-serif text and a small white rectangular button underneath. Finally, include a dark navy footer with small white centered links and light grey copyright text with a small bright blue square icon on the right. Use consistent spacing and alignment for readability and a clean, structured layout. The blue squares are images with src set to 'rick.jpg'.
