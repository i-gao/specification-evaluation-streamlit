Create a clean, professional web layout with a large bright blue image (use 'rick.jpg') centered at the top. Below that, have a horizontal navigation menu with small gray text links spaced evenly: "Home," "Firm," "Capabilities," "Projects," and a red "Contact" on the right. Under the menu, align the contact section in three columns. The left column is small with gray instructional text and contact details in dark gray, with some email addresses in red for emphasis. The center column features a bold dark gray heading "Drop us a message" above labels and form fields for "Your name," "Email," and a large multiline "Message" box, all left-aligned with minimal borders. A small light gray "Send it" button is below the message box, aligned to the left. The right column contains a smaller bright blue image (also 'rick.jpg'), aligned with the form fields. The overall design uses a lot of white space with thin gray horizontal rules above and below the contact section. At the very bottom, center a small gray copyright notice.
