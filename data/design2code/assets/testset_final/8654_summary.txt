Create a clean, mostly white web layout with a small, light gray notification text centered near the top. Below that, place a horizontal navigation bar with four links: the first three in dark gray, bold font, and the last link in bold blue font. Under the navigation, on the left side, vertically stack four simple black text links aligned left with ample spacing. To the right of this list, place a large, bright blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg') occupying most of the horizontal space. Below, add two small paragraphs of fine, light gray text spanning the width of the image area. Finally, include a narrow horizontal footer bar across the bottom in a muted light blue shade with centered gray text. The font style is clean and sans-serif throughout.
