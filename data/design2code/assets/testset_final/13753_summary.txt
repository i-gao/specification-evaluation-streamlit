Create a webpage with a light beige background and a centered, narrow white content area. At the top left, place a large, serif title in dark brown, with a smaller subtitle below it in dull gray. On the top right, include a small "SEARCH" link in muted red. The main content area should have a two-column layout: a left sidebar containing a "Share" link in muted red, a small black "Labels" heading, and a vertical list of three label links in muted red below. The main column on the right starts with a date in small gray text, followed by a bold serif heading in dark brown. Beneath the heading, insert an image (src 'rick.jpg') sized about 400px wide and 300px tall, floated left with margin on the right side. To the right and below the image, place black body text in paragraphs with serif font. Below the text, place share email links in small muted red font, and label links in smaller muted red text. Further down in the main column, add a gray "COMMENTS" heading and a "POST A COMMENT" link in muted red. Then, create a "POPULAR POSTS" section with two stacked blocks, each containing a large image (src 'rick.jpg', about 700px wide by 350px tall), a small gray date label in the bottom left corner overlapping the image, a dark brown serif post title below the image, and share and comment links in small muted red text beneath. Use consistent serif fonts for all headings and body text. Ensure margins between sections and a clean, simple, airy layout.
