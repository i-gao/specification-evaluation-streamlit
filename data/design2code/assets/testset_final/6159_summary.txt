Create a clean webpage layout with a white header containing the site name in dark gray italic and bold fonts aligned left, and a simple horizontal menu with small font gray links aligned right. Below the header, center a wide horizontal search bar with a white input field and a green rectangular "FIND" button on the right. Below that, on a light gray background, place a breadcrumb navigation in small blue text, left aligned. 

Under the breadcrumb, create a white content box with a top-left aligned bold black heading, a small date below in gray, a large bright blue rectangular image on the left with a small teal label overlay in the top-left corner, and a smaller bright blue rectangular image on the right side aligned with the bigger image top. Beneath the large image, include a black subheading followed by a short descriptive paragraph in small black font. Then add a list of nested text links in various shades of blue, aligned left with indentation for sub-items, inside this box.

Below that content box, centered horizontally, add another white box with a title in black and two short paragraphs in smaller gray font, all left aligned. Then add a full-width dark gray band with four columns of white text showing large bold numbers above smaller uppercase labels separated by faint vertical dividing lines. 

Beneath that, create a full-width green section with centered white text and a green rectangular button below it containing white text, aligned center. Finally, add a footer on a white background with left-aligned small gray text links arranged in three groups, and a right-aligned copyright line in small gray font.
