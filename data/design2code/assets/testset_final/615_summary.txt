Create a blog layout with a soft pink background and a white content area centered on the page. The top header uses a darker pink horizontal bar with bold, white, serif font for the blog title on the left and a small search box on the right with italic placeholder text. Inside the white content area, place a post title in bold black serif font with a smaller italic subtitle below. Below the title, include two bright blue rectangular images stacked vertically, the top one wider than the bottom. Under the images, add a paragraph of black serif text, followed by a small pink rectangular tag with white text. Below that is a comments section with each comment featuring a small solid blue circle as an avatar on the left, commenter names in bold red, and comment text in black, aligned vertically with timestamps in light gray underneath. A subtle dividing line separates the comments from the post. At the bottom, add a "Popular Posts" section with bold heading and multiple posts each containing a small bright blue rectangular image and descriptive italic text beneath. The entire layout uses clean, serif fonts, a consistent pink and white color palette, and bright blue placeholders for images.
