Create a clean, centered, white content container on a light gray background with several distinct sections separated by thin gray horizontal lines. Use simple, sans-serif fonts in black for headings and gray for secondary text. The top section includes a "Description" heading with multiple paragraphs of left-aligned body text and two side-by-side bright blue rectangular images below the text. Underneath this, provide a text link area with a border above. Below the main container, present smaller white boxes side-stacked vertically with headings and smaller descriptive text, separated by light gray lines. The layout is minimalist, with ample white space and subtle gray dividers to segment content blocks.
