Create a clean, white webpage layout with a small bright blue rectangle image in the upper left corner. On the upper right corner, place a minimal navigation box with thin black borders containing horizontally aligned blue links. Below the top section, add a wide, rounded-corner light gray notification bar with faint shadow and subtle centered gray text and a small blue link. Beneath that, include a large horizontal light gray banner area spanning most of the container width. Below the banner, add a paragraph of small, gray text describing navigation products. Then list five sections vertically, each with a bright blue square image on the left and a heading link in medium, gray-blue font to the right, followed by smaller descriptive text and a few small blue links underneath. The font should be sans-serif and easy to read. The entire content area should have a subtle shadow and rounded corners with padding around all elements. At the bottom left corner inside the container, include a small "Home" text link, and a copyright note in small, light gray font aligned bottom right outside the container.
