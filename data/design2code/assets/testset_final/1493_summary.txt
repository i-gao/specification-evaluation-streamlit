Create a layout with a vertical left sidebar in a dark slate gray color (#3d4a54). The main section on the right has a white background with a subtle horizontal dividing line near the bottom. At the top of the main area, align three lines of text: a small black "Server Error" message, a large 503 error number in a salmon orange color (#f07657), and a medium-sized black headline below. Beneath that, place a smaller gray descriptive paragraph. Below the dividing line, add a small black caption and three rectangular blue-outlined buttons with blue text aligned horizontally: "Reload Page," "Back to Previous Page," and "Home Page." The font should be clean and modern, with emphasis on the large error number in a larger size and distinct color.
