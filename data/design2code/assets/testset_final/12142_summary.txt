Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background and black text. Centered near the top, place a small line of black text as a tagline. Below that, include a dark gray horizontal navigation bar spanning the width, with home, maps, tips, blog links aligned left in small white font, and to the right, two adjacent pale yellow rectangular input fields, a small yellow dropdown menu with the label "State," and a gray search button. Beneath the navigation bar, center a bold, black heading in a larger font. Below the heading, align paragraphs of regular black text left with spaced lines. At the bottom, include another dark gray horizontal bar containing smaller white text links spaced evenly, and below that add fine print disclaimers and copyright info in small black text aligned left. The overall style is simple and professional without additional colors or images.
