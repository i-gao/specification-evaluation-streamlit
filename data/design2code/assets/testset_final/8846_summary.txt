Create a webpage with a two-column layout on a white background. The left column is a vertical blue sidebar featuring the site title in bold white text at the top, with a smaller light gray subtitle below it, and a small outlined rectangular button in white with blue text beneath that. Below the sidebar, place a small square image (src='rick.jpg'). The right column is the main content area starting with a large blue rectangle (src='rick.jpg') spanning the top portion. Below it, center a bold heading in dark gray followed by multiple lines of paragraph text in smaller dark gray font, with some links in blue. Further down, center four small blue square images (src='rick.jpg') arranged in a 3-1 grid, each with a bold blue caption underneath. At the bottom center of the page, place a small, simple copyright text in black. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
