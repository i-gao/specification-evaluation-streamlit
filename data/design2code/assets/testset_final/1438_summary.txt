Create a web page with a dark gray full background and a light gray central content area. At the top, include a wide beige horizontal header containing a centered, faint navigation menu with four text links spaced evenly. Below that, place a black banner across the content area featuring red text aligned left. Beneath the banner on the left, add a large, bright blue image with a white border. Place multiple paragraphs of gray text below the image, styled with some bold emphasis. On the right side, stack four dark gray boxes with black headers containing white bold titles and white or light gray text inside. The top right box includes a smaller bright blue rectangular image aligned right. The bottom footer should be black with small white text and a small blue square icon on the left. Use simple sans-serif fonts and consistent spacing throughout. The layout is a fixed-width central column with a left main section and a narrower right sidebar.
