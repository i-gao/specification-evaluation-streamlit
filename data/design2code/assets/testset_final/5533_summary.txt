Create a clean, white-background layout with a black top header bar featuring left-aligned orange text "Register Here" and right-aligned white text with the location details. Below, the main content area has a left-aligned blue square image (source 'rick.jpg') and a right-aligned horizontal navigation menu with grey text links (HOME, ABOUT, EXHIBIT, VISIT). Underneath, place an orange bottom border line. Next, add an orange bold heading "EXHIBITORS" on the left, followed by a horizontal alphabet filter in grey with selected letters in orange, and a search input with a thin grey border on the right, plus an orange button. Below that, create exhibitor listings with left-aligned small blue square images (source 'rick.jpg'), the exhibitor names in blue, contact and description text in grey, and "FULL DETAILS >" link in orange. On the right side, add a "FILTER RESULTS" section in bold black, with grey text checkboxes aligned vertically. Repeat the alphabet filter and search input below the list. Finally, add a footer with small grey navigation links horizontally spaced and a light grey footer bar with faint text "Website Design by Dmac Media." Use a clean sans-serif font and maintain consistent spacing and alignment throughout.
