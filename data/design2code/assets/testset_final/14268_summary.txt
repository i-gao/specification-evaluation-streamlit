Please create a webpage with a dark blue header containing white text navigation links spaced horizontally and aligned center. Below this, use a dark blue section with a left-aligned medium-large blue image (src='rick.jpg') and three small circular green icons aligned top-right horizontally. Then a light gray horizontal band with centered italic text and a green rounded button on the right side. Below is a section split into two halves: the left half in medium green with four evenly spaced white text links each with small icons above, arranged in a 2x2 grid; the right half is a large blue rectangle image (src='rick.jpg'). Next, a dark blue section with centered white heading text and a small horizontal blue accent bar below it. Underneath are three equally spaced columns with small white text above and blue rounded buttons below in each column. Then a light gray section with a centered bold heading, a small horizontal blue accent below, and three equally spaced blue rectangular images (src='rick.jpg') with descriptive text below each, followed by a green outlined button beneath each description. Finally, a green horizontal bar footer contains a search input on the left with a search icon and placeholder text, the search field spanning most of the width, and a small icon aligned right. Below that, a dark blue footer bar with white centered small text separated by vertical bars on either side of contact details and a small right-aligned white logo inside a blue outlined rounded rectangle. Use clean, sans-serif fonts for all text.
