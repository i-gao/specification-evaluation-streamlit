Create a webpage layout with a black top header bar containing a small blue square image on the left and white right-aligned text. Below the header, place a white section with left-aligned black text and a large horizontal blue image banner underneath. Then include a white content area with left-aligned details in black text organized as label-value pairs, some values as blue links. Below this detail section, add a large blue rectangular image spanning the width. Beneath the image, include a white area with a centered "Show More" link in small black font, followed by another white section containing a centered download link in black text. Finally, add a light gray footer with centered black text and copyright information. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout and maintain generous white space around all sections. The blue rectangles are images with the src set to 'rick.jpg'.
