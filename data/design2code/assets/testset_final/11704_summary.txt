Create a webpage with a dark blue (#042635) background and left-aligned content. At the top left, place a small rounded rectangle button in bright blue. Below that, add a prominent heading in bold white text with a large san-serif font reading "Niels K." Underneath, include a horizontal navigation menu in smaller, uppercase, light grey text. Then, add a line of small uppercase turquoise text for tags or categories. Below, have a large bold white headline for the article title. The body text should be legible in white with a clean sans-serif font, arranged in paragraphs with spacing. Include a black code block area with slightly lighter text for commands or code snippets. At the bottom, place a small footer in uppercase grey text with a copyright line. The entire layout is narrow and centered with consistent horizontal padding. The dark blue rectangles in the navigation or body should be replaced with images using src set to 'rick.jpg'.
