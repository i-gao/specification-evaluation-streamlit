Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a white background. At the top left, place small black text including the word "shop" and a bold "ireland" followed by ".ie". Next to it on the right, include a rounded rectangle search input with a grey border and placeholder text in grey, plus a bright blue rounded button labeled "Books" with a dropdown arrow. Below, add a breadcrumb navigation in bright blue text. Centered beneath that on the left side, place a bright blue rectangle image with src 'rick.jpg'. To the right of the image, add a bold, dark grey title in a large font. Below the title, include a small, blue, underlined link label. Under that, place a bright yellow rounded rectangle button labeled "Add to cart" with bold text. Below the button, show pricing in bold black for the main price with smaller grey text next to it and additional pricing details in smaller black text below. Center a small stock note below the price in grey text. Underneath, present product features and info with section headings in bold black and bullet points in dark grey, with some blue links included. At the bottom, include multiple lines of small, centered blue navigation links separated by spacing, with some bolded headings. Finally, add grey copyright and disclaimer text at the bottom, all center aligned. Use a simple sans-serif font throughout.
