Create a minimalistic webpage layout with a white background. At the top center, arrange a horizontal navigation menu with five text links in uppercase, evenly spaced: "HOME," "CONTACT," "WEDDINGS," and "PLACES." The active "HOME" link should be bold with a thin black underline above it. Below the navigation, place two blue rectangular images (src: 'rick.jpg'), the smaller one on the left and the larger one on the right, both horizontally aligned. At the bottom center, include a thin horizontal gray line above a small, light gray copyright text in a clean, sans-serif font. The overall style is clean, modern, and spacious.
