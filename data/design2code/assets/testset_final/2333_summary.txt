Create a simple webpage layout with a centered horizontal navigation bar near the top in a medium blue background and black text spaced letter by letter. Below, create two main content columns side by side with black borders. The left column has a light gray background and contains a bold dark blue heading and smaller black text with block headings in bold. At the bottom right of this column, place four small bright blue square social media icons in a row. The right column is white with blue bold subheadings and black text in a mix of normal and italic fonts. Include a light blue-gray rectangular section near the bottom with black text inside. Use a clean, monospace or simple serif font throughout and small, letter-spaced captions aligned to the bottom corners or right edges of content blocks. The page background is white with a thin horizontal rule and small black footer text centered along the bottom.
