Create a clean, vertically oriented webpage with a light cream background (#fff8e1) and a narrow, centered column containing the text content. The text is dark brown and set in a small serif font with subtle line spacing for readability. The layout is simple and minimalistic, with paragraphs and bullet points left-aligned and spaced evenly, creating a clear reading flow. Links within the text are underlined and styled in a muted brown shade that stands out gently. At the bottom, incorporate a narrow footer with very small, orange text links spaced horizontally, separated by vertical bars. The overall design is understated and classic, focused purely on text presentation without images or additional visual elements.
