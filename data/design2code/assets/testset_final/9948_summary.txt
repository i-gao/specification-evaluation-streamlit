Create a webpage with a top navigation bar in medium blue containing a bright blue logo block on the left, a large white search bar with rounded edges next to it, and three bold white text links ("Browse," "Contribute," "Community") aligned right. Below is a light gray notification bar with a small ghost emoji on the left and a message in black text. The main content area has a white background and features a large bold black header aligned left, with a set of tab navigation links below it in blue and gray small text. On the right side of the header area, place two rectangular buttons with gray borders and light backgrounds, containing smaller bold text. Below this, show a black bold subheading aligned left, followed by a grid of four rows and five columns of bright blue rectangular images with thin light gray borders. Beneath each image is a small gray caption left-aligned. Below the grid is a light gray full-width callout box with black text and a single green link. At the bottom of the page, center small gray text links and copyright info. Use a sans-serif font throughout.
