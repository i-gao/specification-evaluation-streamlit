Create a clean, centered blog post layout with a white background and dark text. The top header features three sections: on the left, a green rectangular button with white text, to its right, a tagline in grey, and on the far right, a simple black text link. Below, center a small green label above a large black title, followed by a grey date and read-time line. The post content includes a light grey shaded blockquote area with text, then normal paragraph text with bullet points that have green round bullets. Some inline text uses a monospace style with grey backgrounds. Author info is separated by a thin green underline, with bold black author name, followed by a small grey biography line. Below that, topic tags appear as small green rectangular labels. Near the bottom, a section titled in small uppercase black text is aligned left, containing three grey-bordered white cards each with a black heading, green subheading, and grey descriptive text. The footer has a forest green background featuring a small blue oval shape with a white border on the left, then two sets of small uppercase white label texts and white rectangular link buttons with black text arranged horizontally next to it. The bottom-most area includes small white text with links in light green underline and no decoration. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
