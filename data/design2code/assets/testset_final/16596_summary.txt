Create a web layout with a horizontal top navigation bar in light olive green (#B3C670) containing left-aligned white text menu items spaced evenly. Below it, place a search box on the right with a small light blue (#7DB9D9) search button. Beneath this, arrange a two-column main content area: the left column features a vertical navigation menu with small blue square bullet icons next to olive green text links under a bold teal heading, and a rectangular blue image block above it. The right column has a bold teal heading with an olive green smaller font size adjustment line to its right, followed by justified black paragraph text below. Above this text, include a small blue image spanning the column width. Centered at the bottom, add a footer section with small olive green and black text links and copyright info. Use simple, clean fonts in teal for headings and olive green for links. The layout background is white.
