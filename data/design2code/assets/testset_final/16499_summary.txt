Create a dark-themed website layout with a black header containing the site name aligned left and a right-aligned horizontal navigation menu with three white text links, where the first link is olive green and underlined. Centered below the header in the black section is a small olive green rectangular button with white bold uppercase text. Below this is a full-width olive green colored banner with centered large white text in a clean, sans-serif font. Then another black section with a medium olive green heading centered above a smaller white subheading. Underneath, place two blue images side by side with some spacing. Beneath each image, center descriptive grey text and below that, two symmetrical olive green rectangular buttons with white bold uppercase text. Finally, add a dark gray footer with centered white small text in the middle, and smaller olive green text below it, flanked by light grey copyright and credit text aligned left and right, respectively.
