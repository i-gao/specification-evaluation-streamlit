The layout features a clean, centered white content block with a subtle light gray background. At the top, there are two horizontally aligned buttons: a white "Go Back" button with a thin dark border and a solid dark gray "Print" button. Below these buttons, two small checkbox inputs with labels appear side-by-side. Next, there is a serving size control with dark gray minus and plus buttons flanking a numeric input, followed by three size option buttons—"Smaller," "Normal" (highlighted in dark gray), and "Larger"—each styled with a white background and dark border except for the selected "Normal" which is dark gray with white text. Beneath these controls, the main content is divided horizontally: on the left, black bold headings with descriptive text and bullet lists in black on a white background, and on the right, a bright blue square representing an image with a small caption underneath in small, light gray text. The font throughout is a clean, modern sans-serif style.
