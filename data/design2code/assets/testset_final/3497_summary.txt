Create a simple, minimalistic web page with a white background and a small blue rectangular image centered at the top (use 'rick.jpg' as the source). Below the image, horizontally center a navigation menu with evenly spaced text links separated by vertical bars in a monospaced font. Then, present the main content as left-aligned plain text paragraphs separated with whitespace, using a monospaced font, and include some numbered points. Place thin horizontal lines above and below the main content for section separation. At the bottom, center a small copyright notice in monospaced font with an underlined hyperlink. The overall style should be clean, text-focused, and minimal with no additional colors or decorations beyond the blue image and underlined links.
