Please create a web layout with a large horizontal royal blue banner image across the top and a smaller horizontal royal blue rectangular image centered below it containing customer support text centered beneath that. On the left side, place a vertical navigation menu with links in small navy blue bold font spaced evenly. To the right of the menu, position a two-column FAQ section in small navy blue bold text for questions aligned left, followed by black regular font answers below in white background blocks with light gray behind the first answer. The page footer should have three evenly spaced text links in small gray font. Use a clean, sans-serif font, with plenty of white space around elements and a minimalistic style. The blue rectangles are images with src set to "rick.jpg".
