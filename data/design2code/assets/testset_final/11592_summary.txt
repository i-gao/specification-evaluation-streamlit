Create a clean, white card-style form centered on the page with subtle rounded corners and a thin light gray border. Place a bright blue rectangular image at the top center (src: 'rick.jpg'). Below the image, include a couple of paragraphs of informative text in a simple, readable sans-serif font, left-aligned with standard black color. Then add labeled input fields stacked vertically with subtle gray borders: text inputs for first name, last name, phone number, and email, followed by a larger multiline textarea field. Each label should have a small red asterisk to indicate required fields. Finally, add a full-width rectangular submit button in a medium bright blue color with white text at the bottom. Use consistent spacing with comfortable padding and margins between elements for clarity and easy reading.
