Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a white background and subtle shadow around rounded rectangular panels. At the top, place a bold, dark gray heading. Below it, center a small gray rectangular button with subtle shading. Next, include a large rounded white container with a gentle shadow that contains a short instruction paragraph in plain black text at the top, followed by five numbered question blocks separated by thin horizontal gray lines. Each question block has normal black question text and bold black labels with left-aligned text inputs next to gray gradient submit buttons. Below that, place another rounded white panel with a subtle shadow containing a horizontal tab menu with four small tabs on the left in blue and grayscale text. The tab content area below displays a bold heading with light gray background and a large white input area. Finally, at the bottom, add a smaller rectangular area with a bright blue square centered horizontally inside it. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout and consistent spacing.
