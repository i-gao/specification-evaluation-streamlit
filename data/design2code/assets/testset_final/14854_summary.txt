Create a webpage with a light beige background and a slightly darker beige horizontal header bar spanning the full width at the top. Align the site title in the header to the left using a serif font in black. Below the header, center a large serif paragraph text in black describing a statement. Underneath the paragraph, arrange three navigation links horizontally spaced evenly: "Previous" on the left, "Random" in the center, and "Next" on the right, in a smaller sans-serif black font. At the bottom of the page, include a footer separated by a thin horizontal line with small, dark grey sans-serif text aligned left showing a name and an email line stacked vertically.
