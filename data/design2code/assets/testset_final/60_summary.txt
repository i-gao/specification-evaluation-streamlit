Create a webpage with a light blue header spanning the top, containing a bright blue rectangular image on the left and a horizontal navigation menu to the right with four bold, black text links evenly spaced: Features, Pricing, Blog, and Help, each underlined. On the far right in the header is a small green rectangular button labeled "Log out." Below the header is a beige background area containing a large heading in dark brown text underlined with a thin line, followed by two lines of bold dark brown text. Below this are three white rectangular boxes stacked vertically with fine gray borders, each containing blue text with a bold heading line and a smaller descriptive line below it. The page layout is clean, with good spacing and a simple, readable font.
