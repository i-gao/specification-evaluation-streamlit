Please create a webpage layout with a dark charcoal gray header section containing a bright blue rectangular image centered horizontally. Below that, include a horizontal black navigation bar with three menu items: "Home" (highlighted with a light grey background), "Agriculture Jobs" in bold white, and "Contact Us" aligned right in white text. The main body should have a white background with a thin light green border around the content area, and a two-column layout where the left column has orange and green headings and detailed text content in dark gray. Below the main content, place a light beige horizontal footer area with multiple left-aligned green links arranged in rows, a green "Stay Connected" label aligned right, and four small evenly spaced bright blue square icons representing social media. Finally, a dark charcoal gray bottom footer line with small white text centered horizontally for copyright information. Use a simple sans-serif font throughout.
