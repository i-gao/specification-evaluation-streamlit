Create a clean, two-section webpage layout with a white header containing bold black text aligned left and a blue "SEARCH" link aligned right. Below the header, divide the page into two horizontal blocks. The top block is split vertically: the left side is a blue rectangle with bold white heading and smaller white subheading text; the right side is a light blue background with dark serif body text and a large dark blue drop cap letter at the start. Below this, a full-width blue banner with large white bold heading text. Underneath, a white background body section containing black and gray text with a large dark drop cap letter starting the main content. Include small blue hyperlinks scattered in the text. At the bottom center, place a small gray footer with bold blue text. The font across headings is bold sans-serif, and body text uses a serif font.
