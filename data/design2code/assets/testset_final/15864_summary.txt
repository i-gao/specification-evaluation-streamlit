Create a webpage layout with a light grey background. At the top center, place a horizontal blue logo image. Below this, add a horizontal navigation menu with dark green text links spaced evenly across the page. On the left side beneath the menu, include a vertical list of small text links in dark green. Mid-page aligned to the right, add a smaller horizontal blue image. Below that, center a grey paragraph with smaller black text beneath it. Then place two columns of white content boxes with light green borders, each containing text blocks and a small blue rectangle acting as a button at the bottom right corner inside each box. At the bottom center, include a footer with small green text navigation links, black contact details, and a blue horizontal bar spanning the full width at the very bottom. Use a clean sans-serif font.
