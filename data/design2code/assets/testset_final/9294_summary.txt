Create a webpage with a black background and white text. The header near the top left displays the site title in uppercase white serif font. On the top right, place two small navigation text links in white and dark red spaced apart. Beneath the header, add a welcome line in bold golden yellow serif font. Below that, include smaller white paragraph text describing the site. Center a main content area with two columns separated by some space. Each column has sections with orange or golden yellow headings in a serif font, underlined with thin horizontal lines. Under the headings, place small white text paragraphs or contact information with some names highlighted in bold gold. At the bottom center, include a wide horizontal gray rectangle as an image placeholder. Below that in the footer, add small white copyright text on the left and a small line of golden yellow and white text on the right crediting web design. The overall font style is a serif, and the design uses gold, orange, white, and subtle dark red highlights on black.
