Create a clean webpage layout with a light gray background. At the top left, place a horizontal navigation menu in small, bright pink text with links spaced evenly (Home, Confirm, Wish List, My Account). On the top right side, include a white search input box with rounded corners. Below the navigation, center a second horizontal menu with four pink text items spaced evenly (Aromatherapy, Skin Care, Healing, Natural & Organic). On the left side below this menu, create a vertical categories box with a light gray header labeled "Categories" in bold white text, rounded corners, and a white background listing clickable categories with faint gray dividing lines. The main content area on the right features breadcrumb navigation in small pink text above a large dark gray heading "Product not found!". Below that, place a white content box with subtle gray border for error message text. At the top right, add a bold "Shopping Cart" title in black with a smaller pink item count below it and gray login information link text. At the bottom of the page, create a footer with four evenly spaced columns of links and headers in black bold text with pink link text. The entire page uses simple sans-serif fonts and consistent spacing with subtle dividers.
