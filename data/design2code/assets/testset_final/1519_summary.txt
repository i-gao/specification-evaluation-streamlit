Create a layout with a large central blue rectangular area containing navigation links aligned horizontally in the top right corner in small white sans-serif font, reading from left to right. The background outside this main area should be very dark gray or black. Below this main section, include a contact information block within a light beige box with a subtle border. Use small black serif font for the contact details and italic bold for the "Contact Us" heading. At the bottom of the page, add a footer with a light gray background containing evenly spaced navigation links on the left in small gray sans-serif font and a copyright notice aligned to the right in the same font style.
