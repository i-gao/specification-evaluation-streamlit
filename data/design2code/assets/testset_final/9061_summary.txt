Create a clean, light gray background webpage with a horizontal navigation menu near the top center containing four text links: "Home," "Trees," "Services," and "Contact." The active menu item "Trees" has a light gray box highlight behind it and bold, black font, while other menu items are green and bold. To the right of this menu, include a vertical thin line separator and a small boxed search area with a gray background and black horizontal bar on top, containing the bold heading "Tree Search" and below it a small block of address text. Below the menu, on the left side, display a block of text with headings in green bold uppercase font and the rest in black. On the right side, place a large vertical rectangular image with the source 'rick.jpg'. At the bottom, include a thin dividing line above a footer with green text links "Home," "Trees," "Services," and "Contact" aligned left, and two lines of small black copyright and design credits aligned left and right. Use simple sans-serif fonts throughout.
