Create a webpage with a header containing a left-aligned bright blue rectangular image (rick.jpg) and a grid-style navigation menu to the right, arranged in three columns with white background and light gray borders. The nav links are in blue font with some outlined and spaced horizontally in rows under main categories. Below the header, have a content section split into two columns on a light gray background: the left column is a pale blue box with bold, large dark gray heading and a bullet list of blue text links; the right column is white with dark gray bold headings and subheadings with thin horizontal lines beneath, paragraphs in medium gray, and blue underlined hyperlinks. Each content subsection ends with a right-aligned blue "Return to top" link. At the bottom is a footer with a light gray background divided horizontally: top part includes center-aligned small dark gray text on left side and a large bright blue rectangular image (rick.jpg) on right side, and below that a narrow strip with contact info in small dark gray text, including blue links on left and right sides, with centrally aligned text in the middle. The font throughout is a serif style with emphasis on bold headings in dark gray and links in bright blue. The overall design is clean with distinct content areas separated by subtle lines and background shades.
