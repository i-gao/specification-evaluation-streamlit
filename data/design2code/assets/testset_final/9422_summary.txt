Create a webpage with a solid blue header bar across the top containing a smaller bright blue square aligned left as a logo placeholder. Below, place a main section with a large question in black text "What is 97.7 percent of 7,330?" followed by a light gray info box with darker gray text explaining the calculation and a large blue hyperlink with the example result. Under that, display two side-by-side input card sections in light gray backgrounds with subtle borders: the left card for "Find number based on percentage" with two text inputs and a red result below, and the right card for "Find percentage based on 2 numbers" with two text inputs labeled "divided by." Then include a wide light gray box containing explanation text in small dark gray font, followed by multiple inline small gray highlight boxes containing different percentage calculations arranged in a multi-column format. Finally, add a black footer with white navigation links spaced evenly in a row at the bottom. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout. Images with src "rick.jpg" are not included in this layout.
