Create a clean, minimal blog layout with a light grey background. Use a fixed top header strip in very light grey with the blog title aligned to the left in a simple black sans-serif font and a search box aligned to the right. Below, center the main white content container with ample padding. The blog post title should be left-aligned in a black serif font with a smaller date displayed faintly below it. The blog text is left-aligned in a standard black serif font with sparse line spacing. Below the post, add small grouped tags in light green boxes with uppercase text. The comments section uses small bright blue circular avatars aligned left with commenter names in olive green linked text and comments in black, with timestamps in smaller grey text below. A link to add a comment is placed at the bottom left in green text. The sidebar below the post area lists popular posts with green headings, italicized summary text, and each post includes a bright blue rectangular image placeholder above a linked green title. At the bottom center, place a small green "Powered by Blogger" text link. Use consistent green (#93A52F or similar) for links and tags, blue (#0000FF) for avatars and image placeholders, and black or dark grey for text, maintaining a spacious white and light grey background.
