Create a webpage with a clean white background and a two-column layout. The main left column is wide and contains joke content and lists. At the top, there's a horizontal navigation bar with two stacked rows: the top row is pale yellow with black text menu items aligned left and a right-aligned search input box with light border, and below that is a bright golden yellow bar with black text menu items. The main content area below has a heading "Capacity Jokes" above a white box with a light gray border containing multiple joke entries with black text, vote buttons in green and red, and subtle dotted underline links for comments. Below that, two horizontally separated sections display "External Links" and "Recent Activity," each in a white bordered box with lightly shaded text details and underlined links. The right column is narrower and aligned top, with a bold heading "Follow Joke Buddha" above a small email input box, and below that a "Related Topics" section with a cluster of keywords in varying font sizes in gray and black, centered and arranged as a tag cloud. Below that is a "Top Authors" list with small icon placeholders and a highlight red button labeled "month" among "week" and "overall" controls, followed by recent comments in simple text, and a bold call to action "Know a Funny Joke?" and a bold "Tell a Joke" link. The footer is centered with small gray text and separated by faint lines. Use simple sans-serif fonts throughout with subtle gray text for secondary info.
