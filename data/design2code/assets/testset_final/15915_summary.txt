Create a dark-themed webpage with a very dark gray background. At the top left, place a horizontal navigation menu with three white uppercase links spaced evenly: "WORK," "CHARITY CHIEF EXECUTIVE," and "CONTACT," using a narrow, condensed sans-serif font. Centered at the top middle is a bright blue square image (use 'rick.jpg') sized moderately large. Below this image, center a bold white heading in uppercase that reads "CHARITY CHIEF EXECUTIVE" in the same narrow font. Underneath the heading, place two centered lines of smaller, light gray body text with some line spacing. In the middle-bottom area of the page, place a smaller dark-blue square image (also 'rick.jpg'). Finally, place a small, circular dark gray button with subtle shading near the bottom right corner of the page. The overall style is minimal and clean with high contrast text on dark backgrounds.
