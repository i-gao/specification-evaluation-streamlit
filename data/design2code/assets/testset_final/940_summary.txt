Create a webpage with a black header and footer spanning full width, containing white text. The header includes the site title aligned left and a horizontal navigation menu aligned right with evenly spaced links. Below, the main content area has a very light gray background and is divided into a wider left section and a narrower right sidebar. The left section features a small bold uppercase label above a large, bold serif headline, followed by author credit in smaller bold text, a date in small monospace font, and several paragraphs of body text in a gray serif font. Below the text is a small, rounded blue-outlined button with blue text. The right sidebar contains a light gray box with a bold label at top and a vertical list of blue links underneath. Use clean, simple fonts and ample white space for a readable, minimalist look.
