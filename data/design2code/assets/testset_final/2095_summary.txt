Create a webpage with a black background and a white content area centered on the page. At the top right corner, include a simple horizontal navigation with white text links spaced evenly. Below that, add a horizontal red navigation bar spanning the width of the white content area, with white text menu items where some have dropdown indicators. The main content area in the center should contain centered, bold dark gray headings and smaller dark gray paragraph text. To the right side within the white area, include a vertical sidebar with a small red underline heading at the top, followed by stacked bright blue image placeholders of varying sizes. Some sidebar text is bold red or blue and placed above or below these images. At the bottom right of the sidebar, place a small subscription box with a thin red border, red bold heading, a horizontal red line beneath, followed by small text instructions and form input fields. At the very bottom across the page width, place a thin red line above a centered small gray footer text. Use simple sans-serif fonts and consistent spacing between sections and images.
