The layout features a white background with a horizontal mustard yellow line near the top. On the left side above the line is a blue rectangle image sized roughly like a letterbox, representing 'rick.jpg'. To the right of this image is a horizontal navigation menu with small mustard yellow text links, except the last link which is in dark red. Below this, aligned horizontally, the left side contains a large blue rectangle image ('rick.jpg') spanning a wide portion of the page width. To the right of that is a block of text with the heading in a larger mustard yellow serif font, and the paragraph texts in smaller black serif fonts, including one italicized section. The footer spans full width below a thin grey line, with small centered black text and some mustard yellow links. The overall feel is classic and clean with serif typography and a restrained color palette of white, mustard yellow, dark red, black, and blue images.
