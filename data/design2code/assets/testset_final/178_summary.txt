Create a clean, professional webpage layout with a grey top header containing a horizontal navigation menu; menu items are small uppercase sans-serif text in dark teal, with the last item in a dark grey rectangle and white uppercase text. Below, a second navigation bar in white background with smaller black uppercase menu items spaced evenly horizontally. Include a large rectangular image (named 'rick.jpg') below these menus. The main content area below has a white background with a section titled "YOUR PRIVACY" in uppercase teal text, followed by black body text and a dark blue rectangular button aligned right with white uppercase text. Beneath this, a bright blue rectangular placeholder image spans horizontally. Below the image, text content is in black with embedded teal links and quotes, followed by a simple download link separated by a thin grey horizontal line. The footer is dark navy blue with small white text aligned to the left and a small vertical navigation list aligned right with white uppercase text, all using a clean sans-serif font for readability and a minimalist style.
