Create a webpage with a soft sage green header extending full width, containing centered dark gray text with the site title in medium-large sans-serif font and a smaller subtitle line below it. Below the header, the main content area has a white background with a centered column of text aligned left, featuring a large headline in black sans-serif, a small date line in muted gray below it, and multiple paragraphs of black serif text. At the bottom center of the page, place a footer with small muted gray text containing links and a year, spaced horizontally. The overall background behind the main content and footer is white or very light gray.
