Create a clean, minimal white page with a subtle light gray border container centered horizontally. Inside, place a bold, dark gray headline centered at the top. Below the headline, include two equally sized rectangular boxes stacked vertically with light gray borders and enough padding. Each box contains a small center-aligned gray informational text above a bright blue rectangular button with white text, both centered horizontally. The footer should have a small, light gray left-aligned copyright text near the top-left corner of the page. The font should be a clean, readable serif style for headings and a lighter serif for smaller text.
