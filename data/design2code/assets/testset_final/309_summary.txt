Create a webpage layout with a muted blue-gray horizontal top bar featuring "Log in" on the left and cart information on the right. Below it, include a white background header with a small bright blue square image on the left, representing the logo. Under the header, add a horizontal navigation bar with simple text menu items aligned left, the first item underlined in black. The main content area is divided into two columns: a wide left column with a bold serif headline, a date below in smaller font, a large bright blue rectangular image, and multiple paragraphs of dark gray text on a white background beneath it; a narrower right sidebar separated by a thin vertical line containing a bold heading "News" and multiple smaller news items arranged vertically, each with a small bright blue square image above a bolded headline and a short description, all aligned left with thin horizontal dividers. The footer spans the entire width with a light gray background, three columns of text links in dark grayâ€”left with "Information," center with "Social," and right with "e-newsletter" heading. The font throughout is clean and readable, predominantly dark gray on white or light gray backgrounds.
