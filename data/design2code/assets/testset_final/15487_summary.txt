Create a clean, white webpage layout with a thin black top bar displaying small white centered text. Below, place a blue square image on the left side as a logo, followed by a horizontal navigation menu with bold, grey font and spaced links. Align a small, light grey "Login" link to the right above the navigation. Beneath the menu, on the left, include a bold heading in black with a short paragraph description and a blue rectangular "Login" button. Further down, layout a two-column content section with bold headings in black on the left margin and paragraphs in standard black font on the right. Include a small blue link "Contact Us" near the bottom of this section.

Use a black background footer divided into three equal columns with white bold headings and smaller grey text paragraphs beneath them, horizontally arranged. Provide a small blue "Return to top" link in the bottom left corner of the footer. Below this, add a separate white section labeled "Informative Links" with three blue rectangular images arranged horizontally, spaced evenly, and a small blue "Return to top" link underneath.

Add another black footer area below with three columns: left aligned bold white text, center column with bullet lists of white links, right column with similar bullet lists as well. Include a small blue "Return to top" link below on the left in this section. Finally, add the last white section with three columns containing bold black headings and blue underlined links, with a small blue "Return to top" link below on the left. End with a thin black bottom bar containing a white centered "Contact Us" text link. Use consistent fonts, primarily sans-serif, with bold styling for headings and clear spacing for readability.
