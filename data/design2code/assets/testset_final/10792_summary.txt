Create a simple, centered webpage layout with a narrow content column. At the top center, place a small light gray text tagline. On the left side, add a vertical sidebar with multiple lines of small gray text, including some dark red links, aligning text center and using a narrow width. Next to the sidebar, place the main content area featuring paragraphs of black text on white background with occasional dark red underlined links and a pale yellow callout box near the top. Include some italicized quotes indented with a gray vertical bar on the left side. The page background should remain white, and the font should be a clean, readable sans-serif type with varied weights to emphasize headings and links. The layout is mostly text with no large images or colored blocks.
