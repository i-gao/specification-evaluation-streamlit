Create a webpage layout with a solid blue header bar spanning the top. On the left side of this header, place three small, horizontally aligned text links with underlines and white text: "VA Rates," "Calculator," and "Table," separated by vertical bars. Position a small search input box and a black "Search" button on the right side of the header. Below the header, center a large black serif font heading. Underneath, place left-aligned paragraphs and sections with smaller black serif font text describing the sales tax rate details. Include a two-column table with headings in bold gray text and blue underlined links in the first column. At the bottom, center a horizontal row of small blue underlined links separated by vertical bars. Finally, add smaller, light gray disclaimer text centered near the bottom of the page. The background should be white with ample whitespace and a clean, minimalistic design.
