Create a clean, two-column layout with a white background and light gray side margins. At the top, include a fixed horizontal navigation bar in light gray with text links in subtle dark gray spaced evenly: "My Pivots," "Forum," "Daily Notes," a dropdown "Calculators," "Dictionary," and a right-aligned "Sign In." Below this, place a large left-aligned heading "Emini Day Trading" in black. Under the heading, the left column (about 40% width) contains a vertical list of rectangular white boxes with thin gray borders and subtle rounded corners, each with a bold black title and smaller gray description text beneath, arranged vertically with light spacing. The right column (about 60% width) has two white rectangular sections with thin borders stacked vertically, each containing a bold black heading and a list of blue hyperlink items beneath with black text descriptions. The entire page uses a clean sans-serif font with consistent spacing and subtle horizontal dividing lines between sections. The color scheme is mostly white and gray with blue links for emphasis.
