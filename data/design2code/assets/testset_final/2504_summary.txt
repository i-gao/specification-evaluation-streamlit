Create a webpage with a light beige background featuring a large rectangular blue image (src='rick.jpg') at the top, aligned left with a horizontal navigation menu in small aqua text at the bottom right of this image. Below, center the heading "Personal Projects: Entrada" in a small serif font, followed by a brief project description in small black serif font, and a centered aqua link reading "View Slideshow." Underneath, arrange a gallery grid of blue rectangular images (src='rick.jpg') with white drop shadows and captions in black serif text below each image, laid out in five rows and four columns with consistent spacing. At the bottom center, add a small grey search bar with a "Search" button to the right and a faint black copyright notice underneath. The font throughout is a clean serif style, and the color scheme uses blue images, aqua links, black text, and a beige background.
