Request a dark-themed webpage layout with a black/dark gray background and white/light gray text. Center the header at the top, featuring the site title in bold, a subtitle with a small laptop emoji, and navigation links spaced horizontally beneath, separated by vertical bars. Use thin horizontal orange lines as section dividers below the header and at other points on the page. Below that, align the article date left and a small clock icon with reading time right, separated by an orange underline. Include small black rectangular tag buttons with white text stacked beneath, above the main article title in larger white text. The article body uses light gray text with orange highlights on certain terms; inline code and keywords appear in dark boxes with pink text. The article includes a bright orange call-to-action link and a centered dark rounded rectangle donation box with white text and an orange button. Below, a "Continue reading" section contains two dark cards side by side with white meta text and bright orange article titles. Next, a "Similar suggested articles" area features three dark rounded rectangle cards in a row, each with gray subtitle text and orange link text. Then, a smaller horizontal set of black tag buttons with white text appears before the footer. The footer is separated by an orange line and contains small orange links and subtle gray text, centered. The font style throughout is clean and sans-serif, with emphasis on orange for interactive elements and highlights.
