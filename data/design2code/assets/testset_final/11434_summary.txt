Create a clean, white background webpage with a top header containing three horizontal dark blue rectangular images aligned left and center, the left and center rectangles are wide and the right one is a square. Below the left rectangle in small black font, place a tagline. On the right side of the header, align the name and email address text stacked vertically in small font. Below the header, add one large wide dark blue rectangular image spanning much of the width. On the left side beneath that, place a vertical gray navigation menu with four text links in black. To the right, have a "Past Projects" heading in bold dark gray, followed by four project sections arranged vertically. Each project section contains a block of left-aligned black text describing the project in a small font with bold project titles, and to the right of each block, a medium-sized dark blue rectangular image column aligned horizontally with the text. Finally, add a thin horizontal line at the bottom and below it a centered footer with three text links and a copyright line in small gray font. Use simple sans-serif fonts throughout.
