Create a webpage with a bright blue header background featuring a small blue logo image on the top left and two white text navigation links aligned to the top right. Below them, place a white welcome text, then a large horizontally rounded search input field in a lighter blue shade. The main content area is white with five horizontally oriented rectangular cards stacked vertically, each containing a small blue image on the left and two lines of black and gray text to the right. At the bottom center of the page, include a small blue rectangular image. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
