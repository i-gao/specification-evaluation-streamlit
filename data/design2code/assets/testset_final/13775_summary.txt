Create a webpage with a light gray background. At the top left, include the heading in a simple gray sans-serif font reading "Harry Stooshinoff - Artist." Below that, aligned left in a narrow column, place a vertical navigation menu with small, gray text links in a basic font. Highlight one link in blue to indicate itâ€™s active. To the right of this navigation column, center a large square image placeholder sized roughly 500x500 pixels, using the image file "rick.jpg." Beneath the image, add a short text block in small black font describing the artwork, with the title in bold. Include a small red circular icon next to the word "SOLD." In the bottom right corner of the page, place a small, faint gray footer note in tiny text.
