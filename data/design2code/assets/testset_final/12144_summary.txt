Create a clean, minimalist product page layout with a white background and dark gray text. At the top right corner, include small, understated links and a search bar with a subtle border and a dark gray search button. Below that, place a black horizontal navigation bar with white uppercase text for categories. Use breadcrumb navigation in light gray above the product title "Solar Wheel Rotator 1/2RPM." On the left side, show three small square blue images vertically stacked with light gray borders and navigation arrows above and below them. To the right, display a large vertical rectangular blue image, representing the main product image. Next to this main image on the right, include a white box with a light gray border and shadow containing the price in bold with partial red text, product details in small gray font, and a dark gray rectangular "Buy" button. Below this section, add a text area with small gray details and three white boxes with light gray borders on the right side, containing additional product information in dark gray and blue links. At the bottom, have a dark gray rectangular button labeled "View all Effect Rotators" aligned left. The footer is a light gray bar with multiple columns of small gray text links and disclaimers in an even smaller gray font. Use a clean sans-serif font, consistent spacing, and subdued colors for a professional e-commerce look.
