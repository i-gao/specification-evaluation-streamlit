Create a webpage with a black header spanning full width at the top containing a "HOME" link aligned to the right in small white bold font. Below the header, on the left side, place the title in white bold font "Day Trippers" with an italic subtitle in light grey beneath it on black background. Underneath, arrange a horizontal section with black text paragraphs spaced in two columns across the page white background. Below that, create a grid of twelve equally sized bright blue images with src 'rick.jpg', arranged in 3 rows and 4 columns, with small gaps between them. At the bottom, add a single large bright blue image with src 'rick.jpg' spanning the width of the grid. The overall page background below the header is white, fonts are clean and sans-serif.
