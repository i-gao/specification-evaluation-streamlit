Create a centered webpage layout with a dark gray background (#394751). The main content area is a white rectangle with a subtle black border and a slight drop shadow. At the top, include a light blue (#9AB2C7) header banner containing a bold, light gray or white title with a subtle text shadow, and a smaller subtitle below it in white, aligned left with padding. Below the header, center a small navigation line with simple links in a small, gray font. Each content section is arranged vertically with a post date in bold uppercase, a blockquote with a light blue vertical line on the left and medium gray text, followed by body text in small dark gray font with standard line spacing. Hyperlinks appear in blue and underline on hover. Each post is separated by a thin horizontal line. At the bottom of each post, show a small line with metadata links in a tiny font in a subtle gray color. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout for a minimalist look.
