Create a clean, white-background webpage with a top navigation bar containing a blue rectangular logo on the left, centered menu links (HOME, SEARCH, BUY, SELL) in black uppercase text with a simple sans-serif font, and a blue rectangular image plus a small blue square on the right side. Below that, center a bold heading in large black font that reads “Spotlight Properties in Stockton and the Surrounding Area” followed by a smaller paragraph of gray text aligned left. To the right above a large bright blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg') is a right-aligned small text link in black. Below this main image, place a small black text notice left-aligned. At the bottom, have a wide footer section with three columns spaced evenly horizontally: left contains a small blue square image and contact info text in dark gray with a small heading in uppercase; center is a vertical gray line separator; right column has a small blue rectangular image labeled “FOLLOW” above it and a vertical list of menu links in black uppercase text aligned right. The entire page uses a modern, clean sans-serif font with consistent spacing and minimal lines, and additional small blue square icons appear in the bottom right corner of the footer area.
