Create a centered form container with a medium blue background on a light green page background. Use white text in a clean, sans-serif font. At the top center, place a bold headline followed by a smaller, lighter paragraph. Include thin horizontal lines above and below a central note section with smaller, regular-weight text. Below this, place form fields labeled in bold with small instructions beneath. The name fields should appear side by side with rectangular white input boxes, and an email input field below these, also rectangular and white. Ensure the form content is evenly spaced vertically and aligned left within the blue container, with ample padding around all elements.
