Please create a clean, minimalist blog layout with a white background. At the top left, place a large, dark gray heading in a bold sans-serif font for the site title "Grizzlebit," and below it a smaller, italic, lighter gray tagline. Underneath, include a horizontal navigation menu with four bold black links: POSTS, LINKS, TAGS, NOW. Below that, show a blog post section with a bold, dark gray heading for the post title. The post content should be in regular black text with short paragraphs spaced out. Include a light gray italic date and category label under the post. Near the bottom left, add a bold subheading "MORE POSTS" followed by a footer with smaller, light gray text links and a copyright line, all aligned left. The overall font is sans-serif, spacing is generous, and no images or decorative elements are included.
