Create a clean, minimalist blog page layout with a white background and black text. Place a simple text link labeled "‚Üê Home" near the top left. Below that, add a bold, large heading for the main article title, followed by smaller metadata text. Use a serif font for headings and body text, with bold and underline for emphasis on subheadings. Include dark gray code blocks with monospaced green or white text inside and subtle rounded corners. Insert a large bright blue rectangular image in the content body with the image source set to 'rick.jpg'. At the bottom, provide a small reference section and a vertical list of personal links in simple text form aligned left with generous white space throughout. The layout is text-focused with a straightforward vertical flow and no complex styling beyond the code blocks and blue image.
