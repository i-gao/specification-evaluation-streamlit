Create a clean, white-background webpage layout with a top horizontal navigation bar containing a solid blue square image on the left followed by four horizontally aligned grey text menu items. On the right side of this bar, place two small grey text links for "Log in" and "Help." Below the navigation, include a horizontal beige notification bar with centered blue and black text. For the main content, align a bold, blue headline with a slightly embossed effect towards the top left under the notification bar. Place a small blue square image next to a bold blue username, followed by black timestamp text, and a horizontal black line. Below, present left-aligned black paragraph text. Then show a "Comments" section label on the left and a login prompt link aligned right in small grey text. Under this, display multiple comment boxes with rounded corners, subtle grey borders, and light grey dotted top borders for each comment. Each comment has a small blue square user image on the left, bold blue username and black timestamp next to it, followed by the comment text in black, all aligned left inside the box. Use a simple sans-serif font throughout with consistent spacing and subtle divider lines between elements.
