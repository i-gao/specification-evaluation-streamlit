Create a clean, white background webpage layout with a top dark blue header bar containing left-aligned light gray text and a right-aligned white button with dark blue text and bold font that says "Try Paperpile." Below the header is a thin horizontal line and a small section with light gray text and a small blue rectangular highlight area inline with the text. The main content area uses a sans-serif font in dark gray, featuring a bold, large headline near the top, followed by normal weight paragraphs with some bold phrases and inline blue links. Include a centered two-column box near the top with a gray button having black border and text. Further down, add sections with bold subheadings, paragraphs, and a pale gray table with three columns labeled "Title," "Abbreviation," and "Word/Stem/Rule" with alternating row backgrounds, gray text, and some italic text. Include clickable blue links in the table and bulleted lists with blue links in the "Other journal abbreviations" section near the bottom. The page footer is light gray with small, centered dark gray text and bullet separators between links. The layout is single column, aligned center and max width about 700px. No images except for the rectangular highlight area which should be solid blue rectangle.
