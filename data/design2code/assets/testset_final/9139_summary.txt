Create a clean, mostly white blog layout with a black serif font for the main header at the top left reading "KYLIE PURTELL - CAPTURING LIFE." Below the header, place a short introduction text in small black font. In the top right corner, add a small pink "SEARCH" link. On the left side, create a vertical sidebar with pink links labeled "Share" and "Laughs," with "Labels" in black above "Laughs." Center the content area with the blog post date in small black font and the post title in bold black serif font, underlined with a thin black line. Below the title, place a blue rectangular image (use src='rick.jpg'). On the right side of the image, place a short paragraph in black text. Below, include pink "Share" and "Labels: Laughs" links. Then add a "COMMENTS" section in small black uppercase text with a blue circular avatar on the left and comment text to the right in black. Further down, add a "POPULAR POSTS" heading in small black uppercase font, with a large blue rectangular image below it. Under that image, show a small date in black, then a blog post title in black serif font, with "Share" and "Post a Comment" links in pink underneath. Finally, below that, place a large dark brown rectangular block with white date text top left, a post title in white serif font, and pink "Share" and comment count links. The layout is left-aligned with ample white space and uses pink for interactive links and black for text.
