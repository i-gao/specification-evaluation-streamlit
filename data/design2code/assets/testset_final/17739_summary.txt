Please create a clean, minimalistic biography section aligned to the left on a white background. Use a simple, readable serif font in black for the main body text. Include a heading labeled "Biography" in a small, plain black font. Below that, add a subheading "CV" in bold, dark pink color (#c2185b). The paragraph text should be standard black and left-aligned with normal weight and spacing. Then include two bold black labels "Contact:" and "For internship inquiries:" each followed by email addresses in uppercase, bold dark pink, and bracketed. Keep the layout narrow with ample white space around the text for readability, and no additional images or decorative elements.
