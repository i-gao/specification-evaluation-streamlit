Create a clean, minimal blog layout with a white background. At the top left, place the title in bold black uppercase text with a smaller, italicized gray subtitle beneath it. Below that, align a gray "Pages" label to the left and a green "SEARCH" link to the right. Underneath, create a horizontal menu with four bold green navigation links spaced evenly across. Then, include a full-width green notification bar with white bold text and a clickable "SHOW ALL" on the right. The main section features multiple blog posts stacked vertically with post titles in bold green, followed by a small gray date. Each post preview line is black text truncated with an ellipsis on the right side. On the same horizontal line to the far right of each post, place a black square image placeholder. Beneath each post excerpt, include three small green links aligned left and right. Finally, at the bottom center, place a small green "MORE POSTS" link above a green "Powered by Blogger" text. Use a readable sans-serif font with consistent spacing and alignment for clarity.
