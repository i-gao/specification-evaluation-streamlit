Create a clean webpage layout with a white background and a top horizontal navigation bar featuring a solid bright blue square image on the left, followed by four evenly spaced black text links horizontally aligned in the center: "Home," "Sell Excess IT Equipment," "Buy Used IT Equipment," and "IT Asset Disposition." Below the navigation, split the main content area into two columns: the left column contains dark green bold heading text and smaller green subheadings followed by black body text paragraphs and bullet points with standard serif font. The right column is a contact form with green labels and light green input fields with green underlines, arranged in two rows with two text inputs side by side and a larger textarea beneath them, plus a grey rounded Submit button below. The footer area uses a black background with white text, divided into three columns: the left column has a white paragraph of descriptive text, the center column has a bold white heading "LINKS" and a vertical list of white links, and the right column has a bold white heading "CONTACT" with address, phone, and email details in normal white text. The entire page uses consistent spacing and alignment for a professional and organized appearance.
