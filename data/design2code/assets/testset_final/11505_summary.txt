Please create a clean, two-column blog layout with a pale lavender background for the header area. The header features a large serif title aligned left and a small purple "SEARCH" link aligned right. Below the header is a thin horizontal navigation menu with small gray text and subtle dot separators. The left sidebar contains purple links and black label headings, aligned flush left with plenty of white space around. The main content area is centered and uses black serif fonts for titles and body text on a white background. Include a bright blue rectangular image placeholder below the article title. Popular posts appear as pale lavender blocks with smaller gray dates and purple share/comments links beneath the main content. The footer is minimal with small gray text centered. The overall style is simple, formal, and easy to read with purple accent links.
