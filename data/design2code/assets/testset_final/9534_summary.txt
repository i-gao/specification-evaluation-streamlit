Create a web page layout with a dark teal header that includes a small user icon and "Login" link on the right, followed by a white search bar with a green search icon. Below the header on the left side, have a vertical navigation menu with four simple text links separated by thin grey lines, all on a white background with "Dean of Students Office" in white text above. The main content area is white with black text, featuring section headers in bold and green hyperlinks. The footer should be dark teal, divided into two sections: the left side containing yellow text with contact info separated by a thin vertical line from the right side with three bright blue rectangular buttons horizontally aligned. The overall font is clean and sans-serif, and spacing should ensure clarity and readability.
