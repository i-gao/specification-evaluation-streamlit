Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background. At the top left, place a small black bold logo or site name. On the top right, create a horizontal navigation menu with three red text links spaced evenly: "gallery | bios | about." Centered below the header, add a bold, black heading with letter spacing for emphasis. Below the heading, arrange content in two columns: on the left, a vertical rectangular image sized about a third of the content width, using 'rick.jpg' as the source; on the right, a block of black body text with some inline red hyperlinks. At the bottom center of the content area, place a small line of bold red text with letter spacing as a website credit or link. Use a clean, sans-serif font for text and ensure the layout is well spaced with ample white margins around content.
