Create a clean, light blue background webpage with a header section containing the site name aligned left in a dark gray, bold sans-serif font, and a horizontal navigation menu aligned right with blue, medium-weight text links spaced evenly. Below the header, present a wide content area with a three-column layout: the left column has a large dark gray heading and a bullet list of contact details with partial blue emphasis on certain text; the center and right columns each have smaller dark gray bold headings with lists of links in blue below. At the bottom, include a light gray footnote area in small, gray text with a subtle link in blue. The overall font is a clean, modern sans-serif style with a balanced and spacious layout.
