Create a clean, centered white card on a light grey background with subtle shadow and rounded corners. At the top left inside the card, place the main heading in large, bold black font. To the top right, place three small, blue, right-aligned hyperlinks stacked vertically. Below the main heading, a vertical light blue dotted line runs down the left side of the content area, with small blue circle markers aligned with each job entry. Each job entry includes a bold black job title, followed by smaller blue company text and grey location/date text on the same line, then a paragraph of black descriptive text below. The font is modern and sans-serif throughout, with consistent spacing and alignment for a clean, professional resume layout.
