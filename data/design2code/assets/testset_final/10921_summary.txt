Create a webpage layout with a purple header bar containing three white text navigation links spaced horizontally to the right side: "Create," "Explore," and "Ideas." Below, on a light blue background, place a left sidebar with a dark blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg') with rounded corners above a pale blue text box containing a welcome message. Beneath the text box, include two small dark blue squares with grey text descriptions next to them. To the right of the sidebar, add a horizontal group of four rounded pill-shaped buttons: the first is purple with white text and a small dark blue square on the left, and the next three are white with light brown icons and text. Below this, place a grey horizontal separator line. Under that line, horizontally align a bold heading labeled "Projects," followed by two rows of three cards each. Each card contains a large dark blue image (src='rick.jpg') with rounded corners above a white rectangular section that includes a small dark blue square to the left and two lines of purple and grey text adjacent to it. The entire page footer area is light grey with five columns of links in small purple text, each column headed by bold dark grey text. Centered below the footer columns is a small white rounded rectangle with grey text. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout.
