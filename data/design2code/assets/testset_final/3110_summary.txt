Create a webpage with a white background and a blue square image (src='rick.jpg') in the top-left corner. Align a small search box with a magnifying glass icon to the top-right labeled "Site Search:". On the left side, below the header, have a vertical navigation panel with bold red section headings and blue squares next to country and brand links in a simple font. The main content area features black text with bold red highlights for prices and section headings. Include a large blue square image to the right of descriptive text with smaller 50x50 pixel blue square thumbnails arranged in a grid below it. On the far right sidebar, list "Classic Cars for Sale" with vertical blue images and red price labels beneath each. Below the main content, include a comment section with labeled input fields and an antispam code displayed as blue squares. Further down, show a grid of medium-sized blue square images with red prices underneath, and below that, a list of latest arrivals with small blue square thumbnails on the left, clickable text links in blue, and bold black prices on the right. Use simple, clean fonts throughout and ensure red is used sparingly for emphasis.
