Create a clean, predominantly white webpage with a minimalist style using serif fonts for the main content and navigation links. Place a small, light gray text logo or email link in the top left corner, and a horizontal navigation menu aligned to the top right with uppercase, spaced-out links in gray. Below, center the main article title in bold, dark gray font with a smaller subtitle underneath, separated by thin horizontal lines above and below. The body text is dark gray, left-aligned, and spaced comfortably for readability. At the bottom of the article, include subtle light gray pagination links aligned left and right in blue. Underneath, show a "Related Articles" section with a bold heading on the left and two columns of links: blue article titles on the left and italic, light gray dates on the right, with a "See All Articles" blue link below. At the bottom center, include a medium-sized horizontally oriented rectangular blue image placeholder. Finally, include a small, light gray footer with centered text and subtle icons.
