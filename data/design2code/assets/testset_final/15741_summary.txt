Create a clean, minimalist web layout with a white background for the main content area and a dark green footer spanning the full width at the bottom. At the top center, include a thin horizontal gray line below a simple navigation menu with links spaced evenly and written in a small, modern sans-serif font in black. Below, center the contact section text in black and dark gray, using a medium sans-serif font with normal and bold weights for emphasis. The footer uses white text in a small, spaced-out sans-serif font, with links aligned center horizontally above a subtle horizontal line and a small "Powered by GoDaddy" note at the very bottom. The overall design is spacious with balanced margins and a straightforward vertical flow.
