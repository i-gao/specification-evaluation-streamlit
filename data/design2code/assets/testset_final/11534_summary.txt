Create a clean, white-background webpage with a thin red banner at the top containing white text. Below that, center the contact info line in gray text on a light gray background. Next, add a horizontal navigation menu with three left-aligned text items ("HOME" in uppercase thin font, then "Properties" and "Resources" in gray regular font) and the rightmost menu item "REVIEWS & TESTIMONIALS" in uppercase, spaced letters in black. Below the menu, center a small blue square image. Under that, include a centered gray uppercase tracking text. Then create two large blue circular images side by side in the center with each person's name below in black, medium-weight font. Beneath each name, add three lines of smaller gray text, including italicized license numbers, plus bold phone numbers. Add a "SOCIAL" heading in black uppercase bold with a horizontal line below it spanning the content width. Then center a short paragraph in gray text describing the company. Finally, a red footer with two columns: left side with smaller italic white text about copyright, right side with white text including the business name and license number aligned right. Use simple sans-serif fonts throughout.
