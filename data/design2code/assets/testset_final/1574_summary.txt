Create a clean, minimalist blog layout with a centered column on a white background. At the top, display the authorâ€™s name in a simple, modern sans-serif font, followed by a thin horizontal line in light gray. Below, align the post date in small, light gray text, then the blog post title in a larger serif font with a medium gray color. Under the title, show a brief reading time in small, subtle font. Insert a wide rectangular image placeholder in bold blue (#0000FF) representing the main blog image. Beneath the image, present the blog text in a readable serif font, with body text in dark gray, and certain sentences highlighted in bold. At the footer, center social media links with small circular separators in a simple sans-serif font, and below that, place the copyright notice in a smaller font with medium gray color. The entire content should be contained within a narrow column for easy readability and balanced white space.
