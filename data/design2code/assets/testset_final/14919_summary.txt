Create a webpage with a black top navigation bar containing four right-aligned text links in light gray, and a blue square logo aligned left. Below, the main content area on the left features a white background with blue hyperlinks, black and gray monospace code blocks with a 'BASH' label, black and gray descriptive text, and bullet points with gray inline code highlights. On the right, a vertical sidebar on a white background displays a large blue rectangle image (src 'rick.jpg') above three clickable gray pill buttons with numeric and text labels, followed by a search input box and four vertically stacked black text links separated by thin gray lines. The footer includes smaller gray italic and standard text with a blue hyperlink on the left and a blue rectangle image on the right. The page uses a clean, sans-serif font with consistent spacing and a scroll bar on the right side.
