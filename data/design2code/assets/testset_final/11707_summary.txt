Create a centered login page with a solid medium blue background. At the top center, place a rectangular image (use src='rick.jpg') with a bright blue background. Below it, add two white input fields with rounded corners for email and password. Under the input fields, include a wide teal button with rounded edges labeled "Sign In" in black text. Below the button, add a small white link for "Reset password." Near the bottom center of the page, place a small white text link labeled "About Medallia Journey Analytics." Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
