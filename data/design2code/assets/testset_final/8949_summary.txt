Create a clean webpage with a white background. Place a top horizontal navigation menu on the left side with four text links: "ABOUT" in bold black font, followed by "DESIGN," "FINE ART," and "CONTACT" in a regular black font. On the top right corner, add a solid bright blue square image sized about 80x80 pixels. Below the navigation on the left side, place a larger bright blue rectangular image about 300x200 pixels. Centered to the right of that blue rectangle, add text content aligned left with varied font styles: an italic orange introductory phrase at the top, followed by paragraphs of black text. Use bold styling for select words inside the paragraphs and highlight some words in orange as well. Include one underlined link in black. Finally, in the bottom right corner, add a light gray circular shape about 60x60 pixels. The overall font should be clean and readable, with simple shapes and crisp contrasts.
