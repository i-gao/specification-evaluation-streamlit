Create a webpage with a top horizontal blue navigation bar featuring right-aligned white text links. Below it, a white header area includes a left-aligned blue placeholder image and right-aligned bold navigation links. The main content area uses a white background with a teal heading, black paragraph text, and bold pricing details. Include a light gray sidebar on the right with black section titles and blue link text. Present a light gray info box with a blue subheading and paragraph, plus a blue rectangular button below it. Below the content, place two blue rectangular buttons aligned left with white text. The footer is a dark gray wide bar containing a left-aligned blue image, center-aligned white newsletter signup text and a gray rectangular button with white text, and right-aligned white "CONNECT" text with three gray square social icons. Beneath the footer, a narrower darker gray bar hosts smaller muted gray text on the left and a small blue rectangle on the right. Use clean sans-serif fonts throughout.
