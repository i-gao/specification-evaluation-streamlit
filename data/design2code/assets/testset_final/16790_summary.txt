Create a clean, professional documentation webpage layout with a white background header containing a horizontal navigation menu in small, light blue font: FEATURES, OPEN SOURCE, ABOUT, DOCS aligned left, and LOGIN, REGISTER aligned right. Below, a two-column content area with a left sidebar for navigation in small blue font, with nested bold section headers and indented sub-links. On the right, main content with a bold, large black title followed by descriptive text in standard black font. Include a code block in a light gray background with a subtle beige header containing small tags labeled "yaml" and "hcl" on the right. Below the code block, descriptive text with some inline code styling in gray boxes. Finally, a dark slate blue footer spanning the page width with four columns of links and headings in white and light gray fonts, the first column includes a small white icon/logo and the text "Koding." The entire layout uses a clean sans-serif font with clear spacing and subtle dividing lines.
