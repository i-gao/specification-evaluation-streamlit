Please create a clean, minimalistic webpage with a light gray (#f5f5f5) background container centered on the page with rounded corners. At the top, place a horizontal black (#0e0e0e) bar spanning full width below a header area. The header area includes a bright blue square image (src='rick.jpg') aligned left with text to the right: large dark gray headline text and smaller medium gray subtext below it in a single line, all left-aligned. Below the black bar, center a light gray rounded rectangle panel containing a "Stay Informed" heading in medium gray, centered horizontally. Under that, create a vertical form with labeled input fields for first name, last name, email, phone number, and a multi-line selection box for reports. Each label is bold and right aligned, next to the input field which is a white rectangle with subtle gray border and placeholder text in lighter gray. Next to each input field's left side is a small icon placeholder. Below the form inputs, add a small checkbox with label text aligned next to it, then a centered orange gradient button ("Keep Me Informed") with white text, and underneath in smaller medium gray text is a footer note. The font used is a clean sans-serif with consistent spacing and alignment throughout.
