Create a clean webpage layout with a white content area centered on a blue background. At the top, include a narrow blue header bar with right-aligned login text. Below, the main content is left-aligned with a bold blue "MidCamp 2023" heading, followed by a large bold dark gray "Submit a Session" title, and body text in regular dark gray font. Use smaller bold headings for section titles, with bullet points for lists. Include blue hyperlinks within the text. Near the bottom, add a centered thin horizontal green line above a bold uppercase gray text line that reads "THANK YOU TO OUR CORE SPONSORS." Beneath this, place three equally spaced rectangular images using src 'rick.jpg,' sized about medium and with bright blue fill. Below the images, center two small blue bold text links side-by-side. The footer area is fully blue with left-aligned white small text paragraphs and one larger bright blue rectangular image on the left. The entire page uses simple, readable sans-serif fonts with consistent spacing and margins.
