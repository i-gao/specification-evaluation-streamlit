Create a webpage with a clean white background. At the top left, place a bright blue rectangular image sized about 200x120 px. On the top right, include a light gray search bar with rounded edges and a small cart button next to it. Below this, add a dark gray horizontal navigation bar spanning the width with white uppercase menu items aligned left: HOME, PRODUCTS, BESPOKE, ABOUT. Under that, show a breadcrumb navigation in small gray text with subtle separators. The main content area has a left-aligned heading and paragraphs of dark gray text, with some bold and orange colored emphasis on certain words. Below the text, include a large bright blue rectangular image sized roughly 800x450 px. The footer is a medium gray bar spanning full width with white text split into two columns on the left: quick links and contact info. The page uses a clean sans-serif font throughout and maintains consistent spacing and alignment for readability.
