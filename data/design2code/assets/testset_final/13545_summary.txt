Create a web layout with a dark charcoal gray header spanning the full width, featuring a large serif font title left-aligned in white and a smaller subtitle beneath it in light gray. Below the header is a horizontal navigation bar in a subtle silver gradient with two left-aligned, small gray text links ("Blog" and "Archives") and a right-aligned rounded search input field with placeholder text. The main content area uses a white background with black serif body text and distinct headings in bold dark charcoal. The article date is in small light gray text above the bold, dark heading. The right sidebar, separated by a thin vertical line from the main content, uses a very light gray background with categories and headings in bold dark text and links in smaller dark gray text spaced with thin horizontal dividers. The footer is a narrow light gray band at the bottom with small centered gray text. The overall font style is classic and readable, with subtle lines and spacing to separate sections cleanly.
