Create a documentation web layout with a top horizontal header bar in a solid burnt orange color containing white bold text on the left and a right-aligned dark red search box. Below, use a three-column content area: the left column is a narrow vertical navigation menu with black text links; the center column is wide and contains black headings and smaller black paragraph text with embedded elements such as grey tables and gray code blocks. Include three bright blue rectangular images labeled as 'rick.jpg' placeholders within the content. The right column is a narrow sidebar with a black text table of contents. The background is white, and the footer is a dark gray horizontal bar with small white text aligned center. Use a clean, sans-serif font and maintain consistent spacing and alignment among columns.
