Create a clean webpage with a white background featuring a minimalist header. On the left side of the header, place a hamburger menu icon followed by a small blue rectangular logo image with src 'rick.jpg'. On the right side, position three small black icons horizontally representing phone, user profile, and a red-bordered rounded button labeled 'Get started'. Centered below the header, add a small gray subtitle text and a larger bold black main heading. Below that, arrange four evenly spaced text links in two columns, each with an underlined state and numeric toggles next to them. Insert a thin horizontal divider below the links. At the bottom, have a wide footer with five columns: four columns containing bold black column titles and lists of black links below, and the fifth column containing social media icons horizontally in black. On the right side of this footer area, align a medium-sized blue rectangular image with src 'rick.jpg'. Below, include a horizontal text disclaimer spanning most of the width, with standard black text. Finally, place a small horizontal blue rectangular image with src 'rick.jpg' aligned to the left, followed by copyright and licensing text in small black font at the bottom. Use simple fonts, black and gray text, blue for the branding images, and subtle dividing lines for separation.
