Create a minimalist 404 error page with a clean white background. On the left side near the top, include a thin horizontal maroon line and below it the word "MENU" in small uppercase maroon font. Centered across the top half, add a large, bold, uppercase headline in thick maroon font. Below this headline, place a thin gray horizontal line spanning most of the width of the page. Then a small black text line centered below stating instructions. At the bottom center, have a small uppercase maroon link or button with spaced letters reading "BACK TO TOP." The footer section should be black, split into two columns with the left side having location details in white bold uppercase font with small gray uppercase labels, and the right side similarly styled contact details. On the far right bottom corner in white text, display a small copyright line and a privacy policy link. Use clean, sans-serif fonts throughout.
