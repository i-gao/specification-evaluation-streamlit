The web layout features a clean white background with a thin blue horizontal line under a contact info section that includes black text with blue phone numbers and a phone icon. Below that is a navigation menu with four tabs horizontally aligned, where the active tab is highlighted in bright blue and others are white or grey. A wide horizontal image banner area in a gradient from medium to bright blue spans across the page below the menu. The main content area is divided into a larger left section and a narrower right sidebar. The left section contains headings and paragraphs in black and grey text with a simple sans-serif font, presenting content and bullet points in dark grey. The right sidebar is labeled "Quick Contact" and includes form fields with subtle grey borders and light grey placeholders for name, phone, email, description, and a security code field accompanied by a bright blue square. A grey "Submit" button sits below the form. The footer is black with a small center-aligned text line in white and a blue highlighted clickable text link, along with a small bright blue square icon. Overall, the design uses blue accents strategically for highlights, links, and call-to-actions, with a minimalistic and user-friendly structure. Include the images in the banner area and the bright blue square icon.
