Create a webpage with a full-width light teal navigation bar at the top containing right-aligned menu links and a white "Log in" button with rounded corners. Below, center the main header section on a white background with a large dark gray bold title, a green subtitle line in bold, a gray descriptive paragraph, and two small rounded orange buttons horizontally aligned beneath the text. Then include a large full-width blue image below the header on a dark gray background with some padding. Next, place a white pricing section with three cards horizontally aligned on a lighter background. The center card should have a green border, a small green flag label at top center, and contain two green rounded buttons at the bottom. The cards use black and green text with small gray descriptive text inside. Below that, add a white "About" section with a small green label, a black bold subheader, gray paragraph text, and a medium-sized blue image left-aligned with a small caption below it. Finally, add a dark gray footer with small centered white text links and copyright text in lighter gray beneath. Use clean sans-serif fonts throughout.
