Create a centered webpage layout inside a thin, double-bordered container on a light gray background. At the top, have a wide rectangle with the site title "Renomad" aligned left in a simple, clean sans-serif font. Below that, include a horizontal navigation bar with four text links spaced evenly: Blog, Play, Work, and Favorite posts, all in a monospace font. Under the navigation, place a large box with a bold heading aligned left and the date aligned right in normal text. Inside this box, create two dashed border rectangles stacked vertically containing monospace text blocks with code and explanations. Finally, add a footer box centered at the bottom with contact text in a standard sans-serif font. The overall color scheme is black text on white backgrounds with dashed borders around the code sections.
