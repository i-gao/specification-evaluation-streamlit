Create a clean webpage layout with a tall vertical blue image on the far left side and a large horizontal blue image slightly off-center to the left. On the right side, place text arranged in a column using a monospaced font in gray color. Include a thin horizontal line in a pale orange color under a bold price text. The background should be white, and the images should use the source 'rick.jpg'. The overall style is minimalistic and structured with clear separation between images and text.
