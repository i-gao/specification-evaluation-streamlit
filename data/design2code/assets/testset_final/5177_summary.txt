Create a clean two-column webpage layout with a white background. On the left column, place two bright blue rectangles (images, src='rick.jpg'), one near the top and another centered below a testimonial text area with blue-gray italic font and a small gray vertical border line. Below the second image, add a gray rectangular footer. The right column contains a horizontal top menu with light blue text links spaced evenly. Above that, align a "SEARCH" label right and in gold color. Below the menu, place a wide gold-yellow banner with white text. Under the banner, include breadcrumb navigation in small gold and gray text. The main content is a block of justified paragraph text with bold gold headings and gray-blue subtext highlighting key phrases. At the page bottom is a horizontal light gray bar featuring centered white text links spaced evenly in tall, narrow font for contact, news, career, and sitemap. The font throughout is slender and modern, with emphasis given by bold or italic styles in appropriate places.
