The webpage layout features a clean, minimalist design with a white background. On the top right, a language dropdown selector is positioned next to a small, broken image placeholder and a search box. Below them is a horizontal navigation menu with four links styled in a muted green shade for "Home," "Applications," and "Technology," while "Products" is in black, indicating the active page. Breadcrumb navigation is positioned left-aligned beneath the header area. The main content area starts with a large bold heading in muted green. Below it are multiple grouped sections labeled with a pale green horizontal bar and bold text, each featuring a small upward arrow icon on the right side. The "Documentation" and "Software" sections contain tables and lists with small colored labels in muted green backgrounds and purple text links. On the right side, there's a small vertical text menu aligned top-right, mirroring the section headings' green color scheme. The footer spans the width of the page in small black text. The design uses mainly muted green and black text, with some purple links, all on a white background, and small icons or arrows for emphasis.
