Request a clean, professional webpage with a dark blue header bar containing “MEDIA CENTRE” aligned right. Below it, a white navigation bar with the main navigation links displayed horizontally in small uppercase font, including a left-aligned medium blue square image on the far left (rick.jpg). The "SEARCH" link should appear in medium blue and bold, the "WHAT WE DO" section is highlighted with a subtle light pink underline, and other links remain black or dark gray. Below the nav, a breadcrumb line in small gray font with a portion in medium blue.

The main content section features a bold and large black heading "We inform" left-aligned, with a share section to the upper right in uppercase black text and faint vertical dividers. Centered below the heading is a large medium blue rectangular placeholder image (rick.jpg) with a gray caption below in a small font. The body text beneath the image is left-aligned, dark gray, with normal weight, and a mixture of paragraphs and hyperlinks in blue.

The footer area is a light gray background with multiple columns of small uppercase blue headings and smaller black subheadings/text, arranged in a grid layout. On the right side of the footer, include a medium size rectangular coral-colored call-to-action block with bold black text and two bold subtext links in black. Below the main footer links, a horizontal line separates a newsletter subscription area with a white input field left, and a medium blue bold subscribe button right. Under the subscription bar, show copyright, terms, and privacy links in small uppercase black text aligned left, with a small copyright statement beneath in a muted gray. Use clean, modern sans-serif fonts throughout.
