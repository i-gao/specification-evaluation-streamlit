Create a webpage with a black header bar at the top containing the site title aligned left in a serif font and navigation links aligned right in small uppercase sans-serif font, with the first link bolded. Below the header, include a large dark section with a subtle gradient black background containing the church name in a large white serif font aligned to the left, with address details and a phone placeholder below in smaller white sans-serif text. Below that section, have a white content area with centered text that includes a welcome heading in medium black sans-serif font, followed by paragraphs and schedule details in smaller dark gray sans-serif font with some bold and underlined emphasis. Finally, add a black footer at the bottom with centered small gray sans-serif copyright text and a thin horizontal line above it.
