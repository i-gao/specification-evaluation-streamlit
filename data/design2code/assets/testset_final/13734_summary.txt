Create a clean, white-background webpage with a small blue rectangular logo top-left. Below that, center a large heading with a thin gray horizontal line underneath. Display four cards in a two-by-two grid in the center, each with a top image (src set to 'rick.jpg') featuring rounded corners and a white content area beneath with black headings, gray body text, a bright blue rounded "BOOK NOW" button, and a small blue square rating badge near the bottom-left. Below this section, place another centered main heading and smaller subheading, followed by a single centered blue square image on the left side and a small block of black text to its right. Further down, add a wide footer with a centered heading and four evenly spaced columns of small gray text links. At the bottom, include a narrow footer bar with small gray copyright and navigation text and four gray circular pagination dots centered above it. Use a serif font for headings and a sans-serif for body text, keeping spacing balanced and design minimalistic.
