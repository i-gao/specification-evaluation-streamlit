The layout features a white background with a clean, modern design. At the top left, include a bold blue square image for the logo. To the right, place a horizontal navigation menu with simple gray text links labeled "Home," "Fitness," "Nutrition," and "Weight Loss." Below, show a breadcrumb trail in small gray font, then a large, bold black headline followed by smaller author and date info in gray. Underneath, add a row of six colorful circular icons. Below that, place a short introductory paragraph in gray text. Center a large blue rectangle image below the introduction area. The main article text is in a narrow column with light gray font. On the right side, create a sidebar titled "Popular Posts" in uppercase black small font, with four items each consisting of a small blue square image and bold black post titles with descriptions. Below the popular posts, add a "Categories" section with small gray text categories arranged in a grid. At the bottom, a dark footer spans horizontally with four columns. Each column has a small blue underline under the white uppercase heading, with the about, learn more, follow us (with circular social icons), and newsletter subscription form aligned horizontally. The entire footer text is white or light gray on a dark background. The overall font is clean and sans-serif.
