Create a webpage with a mostly white background. At the top, include a thick horizontal blue bar spanning the entire width and a smaller vertical blue rectangle aligned near the left side. On the right side of this top section, place a search input box with a "Search player" button next to it. Below the blue bar, add a horizontal blue line across the page under the "Top Player" bold heading aligned left. Under this heading, display three small blue square images on the left side, each aligned vertically with player details (text) to their right. Beneath this, have multiple paragraphs of black text with some lines bolded, spaced in a clean, easy-to-read layout, aligned left. Use a simple sans-serif font throughout for clarity.
