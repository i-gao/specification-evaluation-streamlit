Create a web layout with a light gray background and a centered white content box with a thin gray border. At the top, display a breadcrumb navigation in black text. Below that, place a black horizontal navigation bar with rounded top corners containing white text links spaced evenly left (writings, photos, projects) and right aligned (about). Beneath the nav bar, include a large bright blue rectangular image area using the source 'rick.jpg'. Below the image, on the right side, add a small italic gray tagline line. The main content area is below that, presenting a vertical list of articles with titles in black font, each followed by bullet points of metadata in smaller gray text. Finally, include a small centered footer in black text outside the white box at the bottom. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
