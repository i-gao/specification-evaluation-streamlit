Create a webpage with a light blue header containing the large, thin-futura-style text "The Blinds Company" left-aligned with a thin horizontal line extending to the right, and "Wakefield" right-aligned with matching font but larger. Below the header, place a light gray horizontal navigation bar with four small rectangular buttons evenly spaced reading "Venetian Blinds," "Vertical Blinds," "Roller Blinds," and "Wooden Blinds." The main content area has a clean white background with a bold headline and multiple paragraphs in a simple sans-serif font, aligned left. Include two wide horizontal orange CTA banners with black text centered in uppercase, located beneath introductory text and near the bottom of the content. Below the first CTA is a 2-row, 5-column grid of bright blue square placeholder images with white labels beneath each one. A light blue horizontal bar with centered, small-bold uppercase text says "SELECT A CATEGORY, OR CLICK HERE TO BROWSE." On the right side within the content area, place a small, gray-outlined box with a heading and small text inside. The footer is light blue with small, centered gray text lines above a thinner darker footer bar containing smaller gray text. The layout is clean, minimal, and uses subtle color contrasts with consistent spacing.
