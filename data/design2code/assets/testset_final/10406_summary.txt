Create a minimalistic web layout with a white background. Place the site title "THE INGROOVE JAZZCLUB" in bold uppercase black text aligned top-left. Below it, include a vertical left sidebar menu with category headings in small black bold uppercase font and the items beneath in smaller, lighter gray text. Centered horizontally near the top, add a large heading in thin, uppercase black font with wide letter spacing. Below that heading and aligned to the right half of the page, place a large bright blue rectangular image with the source 'rick.jpg'. Beneath the image, include a centered block of light gray body text using a small, clean sans-serif font, spaced out with line breaks to simulate a dialogue. At the bottom center, add a small "Back to Top" link in very light gray, with an upward arrow above it. The overall feel should be clean and modern with a strong contrast in typography and bold use of the blue image on the right.
