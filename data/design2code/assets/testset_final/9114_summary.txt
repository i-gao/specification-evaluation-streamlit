Create a web page with a full-width top horizontal blue navigation bar containing three small, white, underlined text links on the left ("NJ Rates," "Calculator," and "Table") and a white search input box with a "Search" button on the right. Below the nav bar, center a large black serif heading. The main content area is white with black text, featuring smaller headings and paragraphs left-aligned. Include highlighted blue underlined hyperlink text in places. Near the center, add a simple two-column table with bold headers "District" and "Rate" and text links in the first column. The footer area below has small centered gray text lines with links and disclaimers in a clean, minimal style. The font for headings is serif, for body text is standard sans-serif, and spacing is balanced vertically with ample white space.
