Create a webpage with a full-page light slate blue (#b0b8c8) background. Centered at the top is the header "ITRS 2012" in a large serif font, colored pale lavender (#d1d8ff), with a smaller tagline below it in the same color and serif style. Below this header is a wide, pale periwinkle (#dae0fa) rectangular content box containing a navigation menu aligned horizontally near the top with three text links evenly spaced in a light muted grayish tone. Inside the content box, the main text uses a simple, small sans-serif font in black, except for section headings and important notes, which are in bright red serif font. Bulleted lists use standard black text. There's a bright blue square image aligned partially to the right within the content area, sized about 80x80 pixels. The footer text is centered below the content box in a small, muted medium gray sans-serif font. The overall style is clean and minimal with a cool, professional color scheme. The main emphasis is on clear textual hierarchy with red headings and important text in bold or colored, and a consistent layout with distinct content zones.
