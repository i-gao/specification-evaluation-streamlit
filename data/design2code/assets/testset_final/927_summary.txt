Create a webpage with a full-width green header area at the top containing centered white text for the main heading and a subtitle below it in white. Below the header, have a white background content section with a large green headline followed by a smaller grey date stamp. The main body text should be grey with two light blue vertical bars on the left side highlighting specific paragraphs. Lastly, include a faint grey footer text at the bottom. Use clean, sans-serif fonts throughout, with ample spacing above and below the elements for readability.
