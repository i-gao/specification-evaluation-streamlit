Create a clean, white-background webpage with a fixed top navigation bar in white. On the left side of the nav bar, place a small hamburger menu icon in dark blue next to the bold site title "Tidy Cleaning Solutions" in dark blue. Align two clickable text links - "Get Quote" with a document icon and "Call Now" with a phone icon - horizontally on the right side of the nav bar in the same dark blue color. Centered vertically below the nav bar, place a large, bold heading "Tidy Cleaning Solutions" in a serif-style dark blue font. Below that, include two small lines of black text, and beneath those, a dark blue rectangular button with white "GET QUOTE" text. At the bottom of the main section, add a large horizontal rectangular blue image area, referencing 'rick.jpg'. The overall style is minimalist with a focus on dark blue accents and serif fonts.
