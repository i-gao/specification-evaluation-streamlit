Create a webpage with a dark gray header section containing two horizontal link groups: "Sign In" and "Register" links left aligned near the top and a "View Cart" label with a search input and search icon right aligned. Below these, center a large blue rectangle image with src set to 'rick.jpg' and to its right white text with a phone contact message. Underneath, centered, place a hamburger menu icon in white. The main body below the header is white with a bold heading "Your Shopping Cart" centered at top. Under that, place a turquoise rectangular "Continue Shopping" button left aligned above a table with a subtle light gray header row titled "Your Shopping Cart" and an empty cart message in bold center within the table. On the tableâ€™s bottom right, show "TOTAL" in bold dark gray with a price "$0.00" in bold. Below and aligned right is a turquoise rectangular "Checkout" button. Beneath these, left aligned, place a small gray "Recalculate" button with a faint box shadow, and next to it a thin blue text "Empty Cart" link. At the bottom, a checkbox with label "Show me my shopping cart every time I order something" aligned right. Finally, a block of small black text disclaimer spans full width below the form. The page footer is the same dark gray as header, full width. Use sans-serif fonts, white text in header, and consistent spacing.
