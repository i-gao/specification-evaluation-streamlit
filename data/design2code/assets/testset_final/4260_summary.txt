Create a webpage layout with a dark purple horizontal header at the top featuring a white logo area on the left with bold "WORDS" in a pill-shaped dark purple background and "PAGE" next to it. On the right side of the header, place three white bold navigation links spaced horizontally. Just below the header, include a thin gray bar with small purple text aligned right. The main content area is divided into two vertical sections on a light gray background. The left sidebar is a pale off-white vertical column with sections separated by white rounded rectangles containing a search box with a white input field outlined in light gray and a dark purple search button, followed by informational text blocks with dark gray text and small blue links styled as buttons. The right main content area is wider with white background and contains multiple light gray rectangular headers with dark gray text, descriptive paragraphs in white boxes with subtle borders, and sets of small blue link buttons with white backgrounds arranged horizontally under each section. The layout uses a clean, modern sans-serif font for body text and bold for headings, with blue text links and consistent spacing between elements.
