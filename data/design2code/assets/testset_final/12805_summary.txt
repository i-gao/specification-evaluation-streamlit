Create a webpage with a clean white background and a large blue header image at the top, sourced from 'rick.jpg'. Below the image, on the left side, place two italicized lines in grayish text: the main title in larger font and a subtitle underneath in smaller font. Beneath this, add a wide horizontal brown navigation bar with white text links, including a dropdown menu under one link. Below the navigation bar, left-align breadcrumb navigation in small, light gray and red text, followed by a main content area with a bold, large dark brown and taupe heading and subheading. Include a beige, bordered, collapsible excerpt box below the headings, then paragraphs of body text in dark gray with normal spacing. Below the text, provide red links and a gray text box for copying a URL, aligned left with small red text for additional links at the bottom right of that section. The footer area uses a medium brown background with two columns: on the left, a collapsible vertical menu with taupe background and red bold headings, on the right, a paragraph of descriptive text in light beige. Below that is a darker brown strip containing smaller links in muted red on the right and a copyright notice on the left, all with simple serif fonts throughout.
