Create a clean, minimal webpage with a white background. At the top center, place the site title in a serif font in dark teal, sized large. Below the title, include a horizontal navigation bar with small, spaced gray text links. Align a light blue search link to the right side of the navigation line. On the left side beneath, have a vertical menu with small turquoise links labeled "Share" and "Labels," and an indented turquoise sub-link under labels. The main content area is centered and uses a serif font in black; the post title is bold and in black with a thin dark teal horizontal line beneath it. The body text is black with some parts in turquoise links and italic styling for emphasis. Under the text, add small turquoise links for sharing and labels. Below the content, have a comments section labeled in uppercase small gray text. Each comment includes a bright blue circular avatar to the left and the comment text in black. The commenter name is bold, with time stamp in smaller gray font beneath. At the bottom, include a small turquoise "Post a Comment" link. The footer includes a subtle gray "Powered by Blogger" centered text.
