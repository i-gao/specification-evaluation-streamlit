Create a clean, professional webpage layout with a white background and a narrow left sidebar in very light blue. The header has a bold dark navy logo with a blue square left of the text "Provider News" and "Kentucky" underneath in smaller font. On the right side of the header, align a simple black navigation menu with three text links and a rounded coral orange "Subscribe to Email" button in bold white text. The left sidebar includes a search input with placeholder text, two date fields side by side, a vertical blue highlight line next to the "Recent Updates" heading in bold blue, followed by a bold "Categories" label and a nested list of links in dark gray with indentation for subcategories. The main content area uses dark navy for the article title in a large sans-serif font, smaller muted blue and gray for metadata links and date, and body text in dark gray with certain key phrases in bold or italics and a blue hyperlink. The bottom includes two small footer disclaimers in light gray. The layout is balanced with minimal use of color except for the blue highlight and coral button.
