Create a webpage with a pale yellow header containing a left-aligned square image and a centered smaller square image, both using 'rick.jpg'. Below the centered image, place a wide, rounded search bar with a subtle shadow and a magnifying glass icon on the right. Under the search bar, include a small horizontal navigation menu with links in brown, with the last link as a pink button. The main content area white background, aligned left, with a large heading in a serif font. On the right side of the top section of the content, place a medium rectangular 'rick.jpg' image with a caption below in small gray font. Below the intro text, add a row of four small images (all 'rick.jpg') in light gray boxes with brief text captions below each. On the left side near the bottom, add a small square 'rick.jpg' image next to a text line, and below it a wide rectangular 'rick.jpg' image. The footer is light gray with blue links and small text describing content rights, aligned left. The page uses mostly serif fonts for headings and sans-serif for body text, with blue links and a clean, simple layout.
