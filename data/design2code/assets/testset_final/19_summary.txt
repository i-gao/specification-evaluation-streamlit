Create a webpage layout with a bright blue background covering most of the screen. Near the bottom, include a narrow dark navy blue horizontal bar as a footer with small white text navigation links evenly spacedâ€”one of these links includes a small turquoise highlight. Above that, place two side-by-side dark navy blue rectangular panels with some margin between them. The left panel contains a turquoise heading and smaller white text below it, with some lines in bold. The right panel has a turquoise heading and a mix of white normal and italic text in a monospaced font, with some segments in turquoise color as well. The font throughout is monospaced, and the elements are aligned left within their respective panels.
