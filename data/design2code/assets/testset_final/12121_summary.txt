Create a simple, centered blog post layout with a white background. Use a monospaced font in dark blue (#00004B) for most text. At the top, provide a small black navigation bar with basic links in black text. Below that, center a bold, bright orange (#FF4500) blog title, followed by a smaller bright orange blockquote text. Underneath, center a subtle dark blue text line with decorative characters. The post's date header should be bold and bright orange as well, with the post content in normal dark blue monospaced text, left-aligned but limited in width. Below the text, center a medium-large rectangular image (src="rick.jpg") in bright blue, with a subtle border and a small caption below it in dark blue. At the bottom, align metadata and links left in small dark blue text, with a single line of red text indicating comments are disabled. Finally, center a navigation bar with previous, home, archive, and next post links in bold dark blue. The entire layout should be minimalistic, clean, and spaced with plenty of white space.
