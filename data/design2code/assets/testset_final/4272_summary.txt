Create a webpage with a clean and light gray background. At the top, place a narrow white horizontal navigation bar with black text links spaced evenly and separated by vertical bars. Beneath this, include a large, wide rectangular blue image banner (src="rick.jpg"). Below the banner, use a white content section with a left-aligned dark blue heading in bold uppercase font. Under the heading, present testimonial text items each preceded by a small blue square bullet. Each testimonial uses small black font arranged in a neat vertical list with ample spacing. At the bottom, include a footer with a light gray background containing a repeated navigation menu in small black text and a separate line below it displaying contact information in the same font style, all centered horizontally. The overall font should be clean and sans-serif.
