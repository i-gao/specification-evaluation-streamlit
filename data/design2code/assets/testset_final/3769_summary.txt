Create a webpage with a top horizontal blue navigation bar containing left-aligned text links "Request Demo" and "Contact Us," and right-aligned "Log In" text plus a blue "Sign Up" rounded button. Below, add a breadcrumb bar on a light gray background showing navigation path in small text. Under that, place a large light gray section with a bold dark gray heading and a lighter subtitle below it. The main content area below is split into two columns: the left column features a grid of two-column blue rectangular buttons with white bold headings and smaller subtitle text beneath, arranged vertically with spacing, finishing with a single full-width button. Below the buttons, list labeled sections (Popular Searches, Popular Areas, All Care Types) in dark gray text with smaller spaced sub-items arranged in multiple columns. The right column is a pale gray vertical sidebar with a small white disclaimer box containing subtle text and paragraphs of descriptive text below it in smaller dark gray font. The footer spans full width with a dark slate gray background, containing white bold links horizontally aligned and a small copyright text beneath. Use clean, sans-serif fonts and consistent spacing for a modern, professional layout.
