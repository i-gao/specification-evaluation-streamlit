Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a white background. Place a top-right navigation with two trapezoid-shaped buttons in muted brown tones labeled "Contact Us" and "Members" in bold white text. Below, center a bold blue heading followed by a bold dark gray date text. Under the date, have a two-column section: a solid bright blue rectangular image area on the left, and on the right, a justified paragraph of dark gray body text with a smaller blue hyperlink within it. Below this section, include a smaller blue left-aligned navigation link. At the bottom center, place a subtle footer with faint gray links spaced apart and a small censored phone number note beneath them in light gray. Use clean, sans-serif fonts, with bold text for headings and nav items for emphasis.
