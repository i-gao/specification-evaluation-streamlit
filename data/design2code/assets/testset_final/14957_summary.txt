Please create a clean, white webpage layout with a top horizontal navigation bar featuring a small bright blue square logo on the left and simple text links ("Core," "More," "Blog," "Forge") aligned to the right, along with a subtle search input box. Below the navbar, place a large heading in a muted blue-gray font followed by multiple sections of content text and code blocks with light gray backgrounds and monospaced fonts. Include inline code snippets styled with a light gray background and darker text, some with colored syntax highlighting in subtle pastel tones (greens, reds, purples). The content area should have ample white space and a left-aligned, clean sans-serif font, with bullet lists and smaller footer navigation text. At the bottom, create a footer with the same bright blue square logo on the left, copyright text below it, and several columns of lightly colored gray links with small headings arranged horizontally across the footer. The overall style is minimal, airy, and developer-friendly.
