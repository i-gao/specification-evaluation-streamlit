Please create a web layout with a teal gradient header containing a blue image rectangle on the left, followed by an italic white text paragraph in the center, then two small links in italic with a vertical divider, and a small dark teal button on the right containing a tiny image. Below the header, place a horizontally centered white navigation bar with slightly rounded corners and subtle shadows, containing four text menu options, with the last option highlighted with a light grey background. The main content area should have a large blue image banner at the top. Below this, a white section contains three columns: on the left, a bold uppercase heading with a small dark teal rounded button underneath; in the center, a bold heading and subheading with a dark teal button below; on the right, a bold uppercase heading with a light blue button containing a small image and text. The footer is teal with small italic white links aligned left, a copyright statement, and a small white logo with three tiny images aligned right. Use a clean serif font in brownish color for main text and a modern sans serif for buttons and links.
