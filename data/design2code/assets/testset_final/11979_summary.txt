Create a webpage with a narrow teal banner across the top containing small white monospaced text centered horizontally. Below that, add a dark brown horizontal navigation bar with right-aligned white text links spaced evenly: "Programme," "Partners," "Location," and "Tickets." On the left side of this bar, place a small square image (src: 'rick.jpg') in bright blue. The page background is a very light cream color. Near the top center, include a line of outlined text in a thin monospaced font with medium letter spacing. Below that, center red-pink headings in a rounded, friendly sans-serif font for each section: "About our partnerships," "Principal partner," "Gold partners," "Silver partners," and "Bronze partners." Below the first heading is a block of small, dark serif body text. Under each partner heading, display bright blue rectangular images (src: 'rick.jpg') arranged: one large centered image for the principal partner, two horizontally side-by-side for gold partners, four arranged in two rows of two for silver partners, and two smaller side-by-side for bronze partners. The footer repeats the dark brown background, with small white text aligned left and right and two small blue square images (src: 'rick.jpg') on the left side.
