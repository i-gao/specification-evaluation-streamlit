Create a clean webpage layout with a white background and black text. At the top left, place a bolded heading, followed by a thin horizontal line underneath. Below that, include a paragraph of text in a standard font and black color. Centered beneath the paragraph, add a rectangular image with a blue fill (source 'rick.jpg') and below it, a smaller horizontally rounded rectangular blue button-like shape, also centered. Beneath these, include a large horizontal blue image (source 'rick.jpg') spanning roughly the width of the content area. Further down, add a subheading in bold black text on the left with another thin horizontal line below it. Under the subheading, include a bulleted list of text aligned left. Finally, place a small version number text aligned left at the bottom. The fonts should be clean and sans-serif.
