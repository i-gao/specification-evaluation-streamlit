Create a webpage with a white background. At the top, place two blue rectangular images on the far left and far right horizontally aligned. Below them, include a light gray horizontal navigation bar spanning across the page with evenly spaced black text links centered vertically, containing seven menu items. To the right and slightly below, place a smaller blue rectangular image. Centered below the navigation bar, add a large blue rectangular image as the main visual focus. Beneath this main image, arrange two blocks of text side by side horizontally, the left block with italic and normal font styles, and the right block with smaller-sized gray text paragraphs aligned left. Use simple, clean fonts with black and gray colors for text.
