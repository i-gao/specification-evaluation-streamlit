The layout features a black top navigation bar with a bright blue rectangular logo on the left, white text links spaced evenly toward the center and right, plus a bright yellow oval-shaped "Reservation Request" button on the far right. Beside it on the right is a white search box with a button containing a small icon image. Below that is a dark gray horizontal section with a large bright blue rectangular image centered and side-gray panels. The main content area below has a white background with a large dark teal heading aligned left, followed by paragraphs of gray body text and smaller teal subheadings. Toward the bottom right of the white area is a smaller bright blue rectangular button. The footer is black with multiple columns of white text links and contact info spaced evenly, including a small bright blue square image in the "Our Team" column. On the far right side of the footer is a group of four small bright blue square social icons arranged in a 2x2 grid. Small gray copyright and credit text spans the bottom area. The fonts are clean and sans-serif throughout. The layout requires consistent spacing and alignment for a professional corporate look. The bright blue images should have the src 'rick.jpg'.
