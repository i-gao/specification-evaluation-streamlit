Create a clean, centered webpage with a light beige background and a white content container. Top navigation includes a bright blue square image on the left, followed by three black text links: "PROJECTS," "POSTS," and "PUBLICATIONS," with "POSTS" highlighted by a dark navy rectangular background and white text. Below, add a large, serif headline in black for the publication title. Underneath, place a horizontal line and smaller blue links with small bright blue square icons as bullet points. The article text is black with a light gray vertical border line on the left side for a highlighted paragraph. Emphasize a bold label with a small blue square and a bold blue linked label next to it. At the bottom, a footer features two side-by-side blue square image placeholders representing previous and next posts with small blue text links above each image. Centered copyright text in small font sits at page bottom. Use serif fonts for headings and body text, and ensure consistent spacing and alignment. The images should use 'rick.jpg' as the source for all blue square placeholders.
