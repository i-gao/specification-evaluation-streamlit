Create a web layout with a light purple horizontal navigation bar at the top containing four left-aligned links spaced evenly: "Root," "Practice," "Wares," and "Professional Bio" in a simple serif font. Below, center a large wide rectangular block in bright orange containing centered text with a title and italicized subtitle beneath it. Underneath that, place two side-by-side light purple rectangular boxes horizontally aligned with some margin between them, each containing centered text with a small title and an italicized subtext below. The overall page background is white and the text uses a serif font throughout.
