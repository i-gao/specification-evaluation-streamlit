Create a webpage with a black background. At the top left, place a blue rectangular logo image with src 'rick.jpg'. On the top right, arrange three links horizontally labeled "Home," "Contact Us," and "Login" in small, gray font separated by vertical bars. Below the logo on the left, add a horizontal navigation menu with black background and white text, containing four tabs labeled "About Us," "Products," "Solutions," and "Green Initiative," with thin vertical dividers between them. Below the navigation, place a wide blue rectangular banner image using the same 'rick.jpg' source, spanning most of the page width. Under the banner, on a white background section, include a bold, black heading and several gray paragraphs of text. At the bottom, center a footer with small gray text including contact details and a copyright line, followed by a line with small links for "Web Development," "Sitemap," "Privacy Policy," and "Login," where the "Web Development" text is bolded.
