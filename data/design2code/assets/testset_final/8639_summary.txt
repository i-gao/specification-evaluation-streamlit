Create a clean, centered layout with a white background. At the top right, place three small horizontal blue bars spaced evenly, with a light gray rounded button labeled "HOME" beneath them. In the main content, center a bold, olive-green headline in a sans-serif font. Below the headline, include a large rectangular blue image (src 'rick.jpg') centered horizontally. Beneath, add a small center-aligned descriptive paragraph in light gray text. Then display a table with three rows and three columns, with the first column light gray and the others white. Each row's last column includes a smaller blue image (src 'rick.jpg'). On the right side of the main heading, place a small olive-green "Other posts" heading with a bulleted list of links in the same olive-green font and smaller text. Below the table, center another olive-green bold heading with a paragraph underneath in light gray text. Then a smaller olive-green "Customer review" heading with a gray customer review paragraph. Finally, at the bottom, a full-width olive-green footer bar with white centered text. The fonts should be consistent, clean sans-serif, with olive green for headings and blue for images.
