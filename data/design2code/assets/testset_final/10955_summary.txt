Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a dark green header bar at the top containing white text aligned left. Below the header, use a white background for the main content area. The page title should be bold and partly underlined with a larger font size near the top left. Below the title, present paragraphs and headings in black text using a simple, readable sans-serif font. Include multiple toggle switch controls aligned to the right side of their respective descriptions on the left. The toggles have a rounded pill shape with subtle borders; some are greyed out to indicate disabled states, and others have a black filled segment labeled "Off" to show active toggles. The layout uses consistent vertical spacing and left-aligned text blocks, with certain links shown in bold blue text for emphasis. The overall style is minimal and accessible, with collapsible detail sections indicated by small black triangular arrows before their headings.
