Create a clean, centered blog layout with a bright orange header spanning the full width. Place the blog title in white, left-aligned with bold font inside the orange header. Below the header, add a white content container with subtle shadows for depth, containing the blog post. Use black text for headings in bold and dark gray for body copy. Include code blocks in a light gray box with monospace font and dashed borders. Place a hyperlink styled in blue text. Add a comparison table with black border lines and bold header text. Below the main content, add a separate section with a light gray background featuring a list of blog post summaries on the left, each with a small bright blue square thumbnail, bold post titles, italic dates in light blue, and "READ MORE" links in bold blue text. Footer text is centered in light gray. The overall font is clean and sans-serif.
