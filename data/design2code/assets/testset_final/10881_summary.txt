Create a webpage with a horizontal olive-green header spanning the top. On the left side, place an image with the source 'rick.jpg' as a blue rectangle. On the right side of the header, align small white navigation links horizontally: "Donor Login," "Grantee Login," "Professional Advisors," and "Scholarships," each separated by vertical lines. Centered below these, include larger white horizontal navigation menu items with spaced headings: "Giving," "Grantmaking," "Community Leadership," and "About." Below the header, display an error message line in plain black text stating "You are not authorized to access this page." Further down on the left side of the main content area, place a larger version of the same 'rick.jpg' image in blue. Underneath that, present contact information in black text with a bold small-caps label "CONTACT" above it. Include a green "Contact Us" link under the phone number. Below the contact section, place a small-caps "CONNECT" label in black. At the lower left side, list vertical olive-green links for "Donor Login," "Grantee Login," "Professional Advisors," and "Scholarships." Finally, align a small grey footer line at the very bottom with copyright info and a "Privacy Policy" link in green. Use simple serif fonts for main navigation and body text.
