Create a clean webpage with a large horizontal blue banner image at the top (use 'rick.jpg'). Below that, place a centered horizontal navigation bar with text links in light gray, separated by vertical lines, spanning across the page. Under the nav bar, design the main content area with left-aligned text in black and olive green headings. To the right side of this content, include a square blue image (use 'rick.jpg'). At the bottom, add a thin horizontal blue line and a centered copyright text in small black font beneath it. The background should be white and fonts should be simple and readable.
