Create a web layout with a full-width gray header containing a left-aligned white text logo and a right-aligned "Menu" button in light gray with an icon. Below the header, add a white horizontal bar with a dark teal, centered, bold, uppercase heading. The main content area has a light gray background with a centered white container. Inside this container, place a two-column layout: the left column contains a bold heading and a vertical list of light teal links in smaller font, while the right column holds the main text content with dark gray headings, bold subheadings, and regular gray body text, arranged with numbered lists and paragraphs. At the bottom, include a full-width dark blue-gray footer with centered small, light gray text. Use clean sans-serif fonts throughout and maintain ample whitespace for readability.
