Create a webpage layout with a dark brown background and rounded corners. At the top center, place a large rectangular image with src 'rick.jpg' in bright blue. Below it, on the left side, include a centered bold, underlined heading in a light tan color. Under the heading, stack four medium-sized images (src 'rick.jpg') vertically with rounded corners and fine borders, spaced evenly. Beneath these images, add multiple lines of small, centered tan text. On the right side, add a narrow vertical sidebar with a search input box at the top, a small search button below it, and an underlined horizontal divider. Under the divider, place a tag cloud with various sized and italicized tan text words. The bottom of the page contains a horizontal footer bar in the same dark brown background with small tan links spaced evenly: "Network Attached Storage," "Map," "Contact," and "Privacy Policies." On the left side of the page near the top, place four small vertically stacked, differently shaded square color swatches in blue, sky blue, red, and gray. The fonts and text are in a tan/beige color, and the overall style is bold and elegant with text emphasis using bold and italics.
