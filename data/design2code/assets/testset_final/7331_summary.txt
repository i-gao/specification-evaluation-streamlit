Create a clean, minimalist blog layout with a white background and black text. At the top, place a left-aligned site title in a simple serif font and on the right side, a navigation link called "About Me" in a lighter gray serif font. Below, center the main article content with a bold, large, black heading in a sans-serif font. Under the heading, show a date and reading time in smaller italic and lighter gray text. The main body text is left-aligned in a readable serif font with multiple paragraphs. Include several gray shaded code blocks containing monospaced text scattered throughout. The overall style is spacious and uncluttered with a clear visual hierarchy emphasizing the heading and code blocks.
