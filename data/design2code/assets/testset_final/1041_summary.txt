Create a webpage with a solid black background. At the top left, place a horizontal row of white social media icons (information, Facebook, Twitter, email, RSS, and podcast) spaced evenly. On the top right, add a small dark gray rounded search box. Below, center a bold, white heading in a sans-serif font reading "We Got This with Mark and Hal." Under the heading, include a wide, light gray rectangular bar spanning the content area with two small navigation links aligned left in black font reading "All Episodes" and "Archives." Below that, add a slightly lighter gray bar with bold black text reading "Now displaying: Page 1" aligned left. The main content area is a white box with black text, including a bold episode title, date, and descriptive paragraph. Within this section, use bold font for specific phrases like "Download this Episode." Below the content area, include a section for comments in black text on white with a horizontal line above it, and finally, at the bottom center, a small italic copyright notice in black on white. The entire content area is centered and constrained in width with gently rounded corners at the bottom.
