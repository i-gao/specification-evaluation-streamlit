Please create a clean, white background web page with a narrow header bar in light gray that includes a horizontal navigation menu with categories in dark gray text. Above that, center "FREE CATALOG" in small uppercase gray font, and place a small italic "Search" input area aligned to the right. On the top right, include small bright blue square icons labeled "Contact Us" and "Shopping Cart" in orange text next to each icon. Below the navigation, place a large white content box with subtle drop shadow containing a left-aligned bright blue rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg') and to the right, product heading and description in dark gray text. Below that, include a table with a gray header row and white rows containing product details, with a small "Add" button and quantity input on the far right. Further down, add a section titled "Historical Folklore Application" with paragraphs and a two-column label/value list in dark gray, separated by a thin horizontal line. At the bottom, include three equally spaced white rounded rectangular boxes with light shadows, each containing a centered heading in dark gray and smaller orange subtext underneath. Finally, along the bottom edge, add a narrow light gray footer with centered small gray links and copyright text in a subtle smaller font. Use simple, clean sans-serif fonts throughout.
