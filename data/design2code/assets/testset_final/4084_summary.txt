Create a webpage with a grey header section containing a small blue rectangle image centered above a search bar. The search bar has a white input field with placeholder text and a grey "Search" button. Below the header, present the company name in large dark text aligned left with a block of smaller text below explaining the status. On the right side near the top, add a "Similar Companies" heading with a list in light grey text beneath it. Under the main heading, show company details in two columns with labels in light grey and values in black; one status value is in red. Then add a section titled "Principals" with a name and labeled address. Next add a "Registered Agent" section with bold agent name and address below, followed by an "Events" section with a date and event description. Finally, add a light grey footer spanning the bottom with a small blue rectangle on the left and several columns of dark grey text links arranged horizontally. Use a simple sans-serif font throughout.
