Request a webpage layout with a dark blue horizontal top navigation bar containing five inline text buttons in white font, each separated by vertical borders. Below this, center a main heading in bold dark gray text, followed by a smaller bold subheading. Next, place a smaller horizontally centered instruction line with small icons or squares in bright blue on each side. Below that, include a very large bright blue rectangular image area centralized on the page. Under the large image, center two small lines of text in light blue and white. Then include a light gray rounded rectangular box centrally located with dark gray descriptive text and a hyperlinked phrase underlined in blue. Below this box, center a "Tags" line with several small clickable blue text links spaced evenly. Then create a white rounded rectangular container with a grid of small bright blue square thumbnails arranged in two rows, each row containing about ten thumbnails, with small bold category labels in blue above each thumbnail. Finally, below this container, place a search bar horizontally centered, with a bright blue square icon on the left, bold dark gray text label next to it, a wide gray input field, and a rounded blue gradient search button on the right. The overall background should be a very light gray with subtle gradient. Use clean, sans-serif fonts and consistent spacing between elements. The bright blue color (#0000FF) is used exclusively for image placeholders and icons.
