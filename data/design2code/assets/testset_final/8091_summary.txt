Create a clean, minimalistic layout with a light gray top header containing a small search input on the left and simple "Log in" and "Cart" text links aligned on the right. Below that, center a medium-sized bright blue rectangular image (src='rick.jpg'). Under the image, place a thin horizontal gray dividing line spanning across the page. Below the line, center a navigation menu with four textual links spaced evenly: "Home" in bold and the others in regular weight, all in uppercase with a modern sans-serif font in dark gray. Then center a medium-weight serif heading followed by two lines of smaller, centered body text in gray. Below that, add a large bright blue rectangular image spanning about 80% width. At the bottom, a light gray footer area divided into four columns with headings in bold small caps and smaller text links underneath in dark gray. The first column includes a small bright blue rectangular thumbnail image aligned left of the text. The last column includes spaced textual social links represented by single characters. Finally, below the footer, center a small copyright line in fine print and a small row of spaced single-character text links. The overall color scheme is white backgrounds with gray text and bright blue images. The fonts combine serif for headings and clean sans-serif for navigation and body. The layout is centered with generous white space.
