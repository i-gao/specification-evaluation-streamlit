The webpage layout features a clean, light gray background with a header containing a left-aligned bright blue square image and a right-aligned minimalist site logo in teal. Next to the logo, there is a horizontal navigation bar with text links; some are bold dark gray and others are bold teal. Below, a secondary navigation bar uses smaller bold teal and dark gray links separated by vertical lines. The main content area is divided into two columns: the left side displays a large bold dark gray headline, followed by black body text and a gray italicized quote section with a light vertical line at the left margin. Beneath the text, four small teal icons with gray labels are stacked vertically along the left side. The right column features a large blue rectangular image above a wide teal call-to-action button with bold white text, and below that, a white box with a light gray label at the top, a large bold teal subheading, and a medium-sized orange call-to-action button with white text. A thin horizontal dark gray line separates the footer, which contains a dark blue square image on the left and three text columns with bold headings in dark gray or black and teal sub-links beneath, aligned horizontally across the width of the page. The typography uses a strong sans-serif font with distinct weights and colors for hierarchy.
