The webpage layout features a solid dark blue horizontal top navigation bar containing white text menu items aligned to the right. Beneath it on the left is a large square area reserved for an image with the source 'rick.jpg,' with two small dark blue rectangular buttons below it. Contact information is aligned to the right in black and blue text. Below, there is a main content section with a white background and black text, including a header with bold fonts and a small gray badge. Two rows of six rectangular images each (also 'rick.jpg') are displayed centered horizontally, each accompanied by small black captions below. Pagination controls appear above and below the image gallery, aligned to the right with black and blue text. The footer area spans the full width with a light gray background and contains multiple sets of horizontally arranged small blue links on the left and a 'Back to top' link on the far right, followed by a thin light blue bottom strip spanning full width. The font is clean and modern, with a mixture of bold and regular weights for headings and text.
