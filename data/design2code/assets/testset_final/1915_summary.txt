Create a webpage with a black top navbar containing the site name aligned left and a hamburger menu icon aligned right, both in bright neon yellow text. Below that, have a wide dark gray section with a centered white heading. Under the heading, place four equally sized rectangular images in bright blue horizontally spaced across the section. The bottom area is a lighter gray footer with small black text horizontally centered, including navigation links followed by a copyright statement. Use a monospaced or sans-serif font for all text with consistent spacing. The images are to be sourced from 'rick.jpg'.
