Create a webpage layout with a dark header containing a large left-aligned image (rick.jpg) and a black navigation bar below it with small yellow-green text links and dropdown arrows for "FISH REPORTS" and "NEWS." Below, center a white content area with a dark green headline in a clean sans-serif font, followed by a smaller black subheading. The main section includes two columns: the larger left column with a white card containing a blue image (rick.jpg) on top, a title in black, a mix of black and blue text links, and a block of smaller black paragraph text with two blue button links ("< Previous Report" and "Next Report >") at the bottom. The right column features two stacked white cards each containing a blue image (rick.jpg) with blue header links and black descriptive text below. At the bottom, add a horizontal green-to-yellow gradient bar spanning the page width. The footer beneath includes a left-aligned blue image (rick.jpg) and right-aligned small black and blue text with a link. The overall design uses white backgrounds for content, dark and green accent colors, and clean sans-serif fonts.
