Create a clean, minimalist webpage layout with a white background and black text. At the top, include a header with the site title aligned left in a simple sans-serif font, and a navigation menu on the right with three inline links. Below the header, center a large article section with a prominent bold heading in a larger font, a smaller gray subtitle underneath, and multiple paragraphs of black text with one blue hyperlink embedded. At the bottom, create a footer area divided into three columns, each with small headings and blue hyperlink text next to lighter gray descriptive text. Keep generous white space around all sections for a neat, uncluttered look.
