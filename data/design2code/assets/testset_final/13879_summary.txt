Create a centered webpage with a white background. At the top, place a large horizontal blue rectangle image (src='rick.jpg'). Below it, center a block of black bold text lines for an address. Under that, include two centered black text lines with normal font weight. Add a small paragraph below in black text, left-aligned, with some words in bold. Then display multiple rows of swatch samples: each row is a black rectangular container with a thin gray border, containing evenly spaced smaller blue square images (src='rick.jpg') each labeled beneath in small white text centered inside each black container. Most rows have five swatches, except the last row has two swatches spaced apart horizontally. The layout is clean with consistent spacing and alignment.
