Create a clean, centered blog post layout with a thin dark red horizontal bar at the top. Below this bar, place the site title in small, dark red font aligned to the left. The main content area should have a white background and be centered with ample white margins. Use a light gray font for the date, followed by a bold, medium-large black heading for the article title. Body text should be standard black in a readable sans-serif font with regular spacing. Include two blockquotes in light gray with a vertical border accent in a lighter shade of gray. At the bottom, add a horizontal light gray line, followed by muted gray small text for a comments prompt and subscription info in bold. Finally, place a light gray footer separated by a thin line with centered, small, gray copyright text and navigation links below. The overall aesthetic is minimalist with subtle color accents in dark red and gray.
