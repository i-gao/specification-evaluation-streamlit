Create a webpage with a top dark slate blue header spanning full width, containing a blue rectangular image on the left and a right-aligned navigation menu with links spaced horizontally in white font. The "Debates" menu item is highlighted in gold. Below the header, place a breadcrumb navigation in small blue text aligned left. The main content area has a large bold black heading left-aligned near the top, followed by a small descriptive text with a blue hyperlink. Below that, on the left side, include a narrow vertical text block in gray describing the motion, date, and category. Next to it, center a large blue rectangular image with src 'rick.jpg'. Under the image, show a bold blue link plus gray location text. Below, left-align a paragraph of black text with a blue link at the end. On the far right side of the main area, place two small link texts stacked vertically in light gray. The footer is a full-width light gray bar containing horizontally arranged sets of small text columns aligned left, each with bold headings and smaller links in blue gray. Use clean sans-serif fonts and consistent spacing throughout.
