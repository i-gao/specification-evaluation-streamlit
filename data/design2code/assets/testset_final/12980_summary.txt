Create a webpage with a top navigation bar in teal background with a left-aligned search input and right-aligned white text links: "SHOP," "CONTACT," "JOIN OUR MAILING LIST," plus a gold-colored rectangular "APPLY" button in bold text. Below that, have a dark blue header spanning the width with a blue rectangular image box on the left, and two right-aligned white text navigation links: "About" and "Research." Underneath, the main content area is split horizontally: a left light gray panel containing a gold small subheading, a bold black main heading, italicized subheading text below it, a short horizontal gold line, and body text with left-aligned colored square swatches in a vertical line left of the text. To the right, a vertical stack of three colored boxes—teal, mustard gold, and orange—with white bold headings and smaller white text inside each box, plus a centered dark teal call-to-action button in each. Next to the main left content panel is a smaller light gray box with a blue rectangular image on top and labeled external links below in a serif font with blue text links and a thin teal horizontal line accent. The bottom footer is dark blue with a blue rectangular image on the left and a teal button with white text in the center; below are three small bold white text links horizontally aligned. Use serif fonts for headings and body text, all text left-aligned except the navigation, with consistent spacing and borders for colored boxes on the right side.
