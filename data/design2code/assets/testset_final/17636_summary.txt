Create a clean, minimalistic webpage layout with a left-aligned black logo or site name "nLab" in a simple sans-serif font. Below that, place a dark gray horizontal navigation bar with small, underlined links spaced evenly: "Skip the Navigation Links," "Home Page," "All Pages," "Latest Revisions," and "Discuss this page." To the right inside this bar, include a small, rounded search input box. The main content should be in a serif font, left-aligned with generous line spacing. Use a large, bold heading for the page title ("special relativity") followed by a table of contents with indented green underlined links. The content below uses headings with a medium weight and underlined green links scattered throughout. On the right side next to the content, have a subtle floating box with a light gray border containing italic and bold text categories. At the bottom of the page, include a footer with small, underlined, gray navigation links spaced out horizontally and a lightly italicized revision note above them. The background is white throughout, and spacing is airy with consistent margins on all sides.
