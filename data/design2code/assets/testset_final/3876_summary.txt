Create a clean, modern webpage with a dark gray fixed top navigation bar containing four centered white text links in a small uppercase font with slight tracking. Below, have a wide black hero section with a centered italic white heading in a cursive-style font near the bottom. Underneath, a wide light gray horizontal band spans the page. Next, a white section with a small uppercase heading centered above two columns: a bright blue rectangular image placeholder on the left, and a block of small, bolded, gray text on the right. Further down, centered small uppercase gray text labels "SOCIAL" and "CONTACT ME" appear spaced vertically. Below "CONTACT ME," place a small black heading for inquiries above a vertical form with white input fields and light gray borders for name, email, and message, followed by a centered rectangular white button outlined in black with black text and horizontal lines on each side. At the very bottom, include small gray legal and hours text centered on a white background, then a dark gray footer with small uppercase white text aligned left, center, and right. Use minimalist spacing and clean sans-serif fonts except for the cursive heading. The blue area uses an image element with source set to 'rick.jpg'.
