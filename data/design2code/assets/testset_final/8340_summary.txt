Create a clean, centered white webpage layout with a small bold blue rectangular logo at the top center. Below it place a large black heading reading "Video Conferencing." Under the heading, vertically align three bright blue rectangular buttons labeled "Join," "Host," and "Sign in" on the left, each with white text. To the right of each button, place a short black text description aligned horizontally: "Connect to a meeting in progress," "Start a meeting," and "Configure your account." Below these elements, add a small black text line containing a hyperlink in blue text labeled "Zoom." Finally, create a horizontal footer at the bottom with light gray text options "Getting Started," "Download Client," and "Zoom Support," spaced evenly on a white background. Use a simple sans-serif font throughout.
