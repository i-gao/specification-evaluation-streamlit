Please create a webpage with a light gray background and a white content container centered on the page. At the top left inside the container, place a square image (src set to "rick.jpg"). On the top right, create a small horizontal text navigation menu with simple, dark gray font, the last item in bright pink. Below the header image and to the left, create a horizontal navigation menu with text links spaced evenly in uppercase and a subtle white shadow. Below this menu, add a large horizontal banner image (src "rick.jpg").

Under the banner, the main content area is white with black text and magenta accent text for links or highlights. On the left side, display a form with labeled text input fields and a multiline text area, separated by horizontal lines, and a magenta-colored submit button with white text. On the right side, stack three medium-sized square images (all "rick.jpg") vertically with white spacing between them.

At the bottom, create a wide footer with a vertical gradient background from dark magenta to bright magenta. Within the footer, place a smaller rectangular image on the left (src "rick.jpg") above a white button with magenta text. Next to the image, arrange site navigation links in columns with small white text, and contact information on the right side. At the very bottom, add a thin blue strip and a thin horizontal line above copyright and design credits in small white text, aligned left and right respectively. The fonts throughout should be clean and sans-serif for readability.
