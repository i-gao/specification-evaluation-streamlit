Create a clean webpage with a black horizontal top navigation bar featuring four left-aligned white and grey text links. Below, place a vibrant blue rectangular image on the left side. To the right and below that, center a bold, large headline in serif font reading "PILLARS." Underneath, include multiple paragraphs of left-aligned body text in a simple sans-serif font. Next, center an uppercase section heading in a medium grey sans-serif font, followed by a paragraph of smaller text. Then include a full-width, light grey-bordered table with three columns labeled in bold as "Pillar," "Main Task," and "Notes." The table background alternate rows in subtle shading. Below the table, add two section headings in uppercase medium gray text with bulleted lists beneath them, all left-aligned. Include a small link in blue text under the lists and conclude with a bold, small paragraph emphasizing a note. The overall layout is spacious with a white background and consistent grayscale text, using distinct fonts for headings and body.
