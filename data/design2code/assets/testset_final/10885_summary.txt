Please create a clean, white webpage layout with a two-column design. On the left side, include a narrow vertical navigation box with a light gray background containing the heading "Navigation" in bold dark gray text. Below the heading, list navigation links in medium blue, with normal font weight, spaced vertically. On the right side, have a main content area with black body text on white background using a serif font. The main title should be a large, bold, black serif font. Subheadings appear smaller and in bold serif font, with some text in medium gray and blue link text for emphasis. Include code blocks in light gray shaded boxes with monospaced font and some colored syntax. At the bottom of the main column, incorporate a small footer area with a light gray background and smaller serif font text including bullet points and blue links. Keep the layout centered with plenty of white space around.
