Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a black header featuring the site name in bold white serif font on the left and a right-aligned navigation menu with small, bold white sans-serif links spaced evenly. Below the header, center a bold black heading above a short paragraph of standard black text on a white background. The main content area is a large, rounded rectangle with a very light gray background, containing a two-column form: left column with labeled dropdown and text fields in bold black font, right column with text fields aligned horizontally, and a wide email address field spanning the container. Below that, separated by a thin horizontal line, place a two-column section with bold labels on the left and a large multiline textbox on the right. Beneath the form are two side-by-side blue buttons with white text labeled "Submit" and "Reset." The footer uses black background and is divided into two sections with small white text including bold headings and smaller links below, all left-aligned. Finally, a dark gray strip with small centered white copyright text finishes the page.
