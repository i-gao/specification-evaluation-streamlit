Create a blog layout with a solid brick-red header background that includes the blog title in bold white serif font and a tagline in smaller, lighter text beneath. Below the header, present the main blog post area with a white background box centered on a light grey page background. The post's title should be bold black, with a subtle gray publication date and an orange author link just below it. The post content uses a clean sans-serif font in dark gray with ample line spacing, and tags appear as rounded grey badges. A horizontal dotted line separates the post content from the orange "Post a Comment" link beneath. Below the main post, display a "Popular posts from this blog" section in smaller gray text, with post titles in bold black. Next to each popular post title is a small bright blue square image placeholder. Post excerpt text is gray and the "READ MORE" link is bold and orange. The bottom footer area contains a small orange "Powered by Blogger" link and a faint credit line in gray with an orange link.
