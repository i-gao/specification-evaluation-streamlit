Please create a webpage layout with a light cream background header containing three blue image placeholders: a large vertical rectangle on the left, a smaller square centered above a wide, rounded rectangular white search bar in the middle. Below the search bar, place a small horizontal navigation with links labeled "Web," "Images," "Kimages," and a highlighted pink "Kpedia" button in the center. The main content area is white with two columns: left column has a page title in a large serif font, a hyperlink below it, bolded and normal text content, and a light gray box containing a "Contents" heading and links in blue. The right column features a small info box with black and bold headings and two rows of text. In the main column beneath, include smaller section headings in black, black paragraph text, bullet points, and numbered lists with small blue image placeholders aligned left or right inside relevant sections. At the bottom left side, show two small blue image placeholders in boxes with captions. The overall font should be a clean serif for headings and sans-serif for body text, with standard blue hyperlinks. Finally, a light gray footer with blue and black text and multiple small links is included at the bottom. All blue rectangles are images with src='rick.jpg'.
