Create a clean, two-column layout on a white background. The left column features a heading in a simple serif font aligned left, followed by paragraph text in a smaller, regular serif font in black. Below this text, include a link styled in light blue. To the right of this text block, place a bright blue rectangular image with the source 'rick.jpg'. The right column has two rectangular info boxes: the top box is chartreuse green with white text, the bottom box is a muted blue with white text. Above these boxes, place a light blue and a red circular shape overlapping in the corner. Below the boxes, include a black horizontal bar with bold white text inside. Under this bar, list contact details and links in small blue text, with a red accent heading for a sub-section. The footer is separated by a light grey background and contains small links in blue, dark grey text, and four small colored circular icons in navy, light blue, red, and magenta arranged horizontally. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout with consistent spacing and alignment.
