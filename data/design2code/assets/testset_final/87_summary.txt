Please create a clean, professional webpage layout with a white background and a top header bar in muted blue-gray spanning full width. Below the header, include a wide horizontal bar in medium blue across the page for a page title area. On the left side below that, place a vertical navigation menu of rounded rectangular buttons in the same muted blue-gray, stacked vertically with equal spacing. The bottom-most button area should be a dark navy blue rectangle containing bold white text links. To the right of the vertical menu, add the main content area with a thin light gray horizontal line near the top. The text uses small, dark blue font with some bold headings. The bottom footer area should have a thin gray top border and multiple columns of small blue text links arranged horizontally, each column with a heading in darker gray. At the very bottom, place a full-width blue-gray footer bar with white text aligned right showing helpline, sitemap, links, and design credit. Use simple sans-serif fonts throughout. The left menu buttons and footer bar shapes are softly rounded corners. Include images labeled 'rick.jpg' in the dark navy blue rectangle on the left menu area.
