Create a clean, minimalistic webpage with a light gray background. At the top left, display the site name "CyberPics" in a large, thin, dark gray sans-serif font with the tagline "Free Image Host" below it in smaller, lighter text. On the top right, place a white search box next to a small bright orange "Search" button. Below that, create a horizontal navigation menu with the items "HOME," "FAQ," "TERMS OF SERVICE," and "CONTACT US," where "TERMS OF SERVICE" is highlighted with an orange underline. A dark gray horizontal line separates the header from the content. The main content area features headings "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" in medium gray text. Under each heading, place rounded white boxes with subtle drop shadows containing bullet point text in small gray font. At the bottom, include a thin horizontal line above a footer with small, gray copyright and design credit text on the left and a small "image Feed" button on the right. Use consistent sans-serif fonts with a neat and organized layout.
