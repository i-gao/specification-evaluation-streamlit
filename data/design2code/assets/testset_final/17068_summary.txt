Create a clean, minimalistic product page layout with a white background. At the top left, place a blue square image (src='rick.jpg'). Center horizontally a simple navigation menu to the right of the image with plain black text links: Home, Sword, Knife, Karambit. Below, left-align a large blue rectangular product image (src='rick.jpg') linking to product detail. To the right of this image, display a bold, dark gray product title in larger font, followed by the price in smaller gray font. Below that, add a medium gray rectangular "Add to Cart" button in uppercase white text. Under the button, present product description text in smaller gray font, spaced with line breaks and bullet points. At the bottom right of the product description area, place three small, white-outlined buttons labeled SHARE, TWEET, and PIN IT in uppercase gray text. At the very bottom center of the page, add a small gray footer with copyright and platform info in fine font. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout with ample white space.
