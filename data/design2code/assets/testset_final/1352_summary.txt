Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a white background and deep red (#8B0032 approx.) accent bars at the top and below the header. The top bar is narrow, followed by a white header section containing a left-aligned italic bold serif title in deep red with a thin underline, and below it smaller spaced italic text. Below the header, include a horizontal navigation bar in the deep red color with six evenly spaced text links in a serif font, white color, with one link underlined to indicate active state. The large main content area below is white and mostly empty. At the bottom of the content area, place a horizontal deep red line. Below that, create a two-column section: left column with a bold deep red heading and black paragraph text including bulleted lists with small deep red bullet points; right column with a bold deep red heading and contact info text aligned left. The entire layout should be framed with white margins and a light grey page background. Use a serif font throughout for headings and body text.
