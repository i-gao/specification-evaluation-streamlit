Create a clean, modern webpage with a white header containing a bright blue rectangular image on the left and simple black text navigation links ("About," "Jobs," "Company Site") aligned on the right. Below, have a large light gray section with a centered bold headline in dark gray and a paragraph of smaller gray text beneath it. The next white section features a centered bold heading in dark gray with a follow-up smaller gray subtitle. Below that, place two horizontally aligned pill-shaped buttons: a dark teal active button labeled "All Locations" and a light gray inactive button labeled "Ellicott City, MD." Then include a centered light gray rounded rectangle card with a position title in bold, location text beneath, a job description in small text, and a teal rounded "View Job" button on the right side of the card. Finally, have a light beige footer separated by a thin gray border containing small gray text centered above three small bright blue square images horizontally spaced in the center. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout with a consistent minimalist style.
