Create a clean, white background webpage with a top navigation area. On the left top corner, place a small blue text link, and on the right top corner, have three blue text links spaced evenly. Centered below that, include a left-aligned article area with a bold heading in black, followed by a smaller black date line. Below that, embed a rectangular blue image with the src attribute set to 'rick.jpg', sized to about 700px wide by 400px tall. Under the image, include multiple paragraphs of black text, some italicized and some with blue hyperlink text. Insert a thin horizontal line in the center above the last paragraphs. Use a simple, readable sans-serif font throughout, with standard spacing and margin.
