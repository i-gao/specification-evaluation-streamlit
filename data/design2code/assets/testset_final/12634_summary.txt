Create a mostly white, minimalist webpage layout with two large images (using 'rick.jpg' for the src) at the top and near the middle. Below the top image, place a casual handwritten-style text centered. Underneath, have a multi-line horizontal navigation menu with text links spaced evenly and centered using a serif font in dark gray. Below the navigation, include a row of four small, equally spaced gray square icons. Centered in the middle section, add a large dark gray serif heading. Beneath this heading, include a smaller, light gray centered paragraph for a description. Below the middle image, place a centered caption in small light gray text. At the bottom, include a subtle, small "Back to Top" link in light gray, then a small italicized footer line in gray with an email placeholder, all centered. The overall font for body text should be a clean serif style.
