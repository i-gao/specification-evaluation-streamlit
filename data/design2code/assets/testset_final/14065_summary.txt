Create a clean, white-content webpage with a teal horizontal top navigation bar containing the site name on the left and three right-aligned menu links in small, light font. Below this, place a heading in medium grey, followed by a smaller location line and a large blue image (src='rick.jpg'). Underneath, include multiple paragraphs of left-aligned light grey text. On the left side below, display contact info in small dark grey text with two subtle pink links. Present four small blue rectangular images in a horizontal row with grey captions beneath each. Below that, add a wide table with subtle grey borders containing column headers and content in light and dark grey text in a clean, sans-serif font. Beneath the table, place two horizontally aligned buttons: a minimal outlined "Back" button on the left and a solid pink "Book Now" button on the right. The footer is a dark slate blue full-width bar segmented into four columns with small light grey text links grouped under headings, and below that a narrow darker bar with centered copyright text. The overall font is slender sans-serif, with consistent spacing and minimalistic styling.
