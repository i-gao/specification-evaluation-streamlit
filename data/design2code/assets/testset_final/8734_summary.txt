Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a soft gray header containing a small black site name aligned left and a horizontal navigation menu aligned center with four text links separated by vertical lines; the first link is light blue and the others are gray. Below the header, center a large dark gray serif heading. Below it, place a smaller black paragraph with a subtle blue hyperlink inline. Then present a numbered list with each item having a bold title and a smaller black paragraph description, all left aligned on a white background. The footer is a full-width medium blue bar with white copyright text and a small blue hyperlink aligned left. Use simple fonts like serif for headings and sans-serif for body text, with ample white space.
