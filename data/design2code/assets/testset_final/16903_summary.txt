Create a webpage layout with a dark blue header background containing a small rectangular image on the left (src 'rick.jpg'), a prominent white bold heading below it aligned left, smaller white subheading text, two side-by-side buttons (one pink, one bright cyan) below the text, and a small text link underneath. On the top right is a small bright cyan button labeled "Sign in." To the right of the large heading section is a large rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg'). Below the header is a white main content area with centered text including headings in bold black and paragraphs in regular black font. At the bottom of the main content is a row of three small cyan pill-shaped buttons aligned center. Below that is a full-width teal section with a heading centered above three rows of pill-shaped teal buttons with white text. The footer below is dark navy with three columns of smaller white text links and headings. The entire page uses a clean, sans-serif font with bold, large headings and normal weight body text.
