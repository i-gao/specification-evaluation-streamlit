Create a webpage layout with a left vertical navigation bar and a main content area on the right. The background behind the entire layout is dark gray. The left sidebar is narrow, white background, with a vertical list of small blue text links spaced evenly, aligned left. At the top left in the sidebar, place a square blue image 100x100. The main content area has a white background with a thin dashed blue vertical border separating it from the sidebar. At top-left of main area, show a 100x100 blue square image next to a bold, dark red heading text. Below heading, place black paragraph text in a serif font. Under the text, display multiple sections with bold, dark red subheadings. Beneath subheadings, arrange multiple small blue rounded square images (5 in a row with some spacing) each with a small blue caption text below. Use small serif font for the captions. There is also a small horizontal control bar below the main text with blue links and a thin orange border. At the bottom of the left sidebar area, include a rectangular blue image next to a small blue text link. The overall font is serif, the color scheme uses white backgrounds with blue and dark red accent colors.
