Create a clean, elegant web page with a light gray background. Centered at the top is a wide header with uppercase serif text spaced widely for the main title, followed by a smaller italicized subtitle line in a soft gray, and a horizontal navigation menu with links in small uppercase serif text spaced evenly. Below is a large, centered blue rectangle image with a subtle white drop shadow. Underneath, there is a centered section containing a page title in spaced uppercase serif text, a small subheading, a short paragraph, and a bold, uppercase link line all center-aligned. Then, place two horizontally stacked white card containers each with subtle shadows: each card includes a small uppercase serif heading on top left, a smaller blue rectangle image on the left, and a descriptive text block on the right. Under each image is a dropdown size selector and a small "Add to Cart" button. Below the cards, add a centered small paragraph in muted gray, then a bold line of text followed by share and follow icons in blue squares spaced horizontally in a row. The footer features a dark blue background with three evenly spaced columns of white uppercase serif headings and smaller paragraph text, plus a small centered search bar with a search button and a copyright line below in white.
