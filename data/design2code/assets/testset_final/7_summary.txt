Create a minimalistic webpage with a light gray background. At the top left, have three lines of black text vertically stacked for navigation links. To the right, place a small block of text in black and two small black-outlined buttons labeled "DONATE" and "NEWSLETTER" horizontally aligned. Next to this is a short paragraph in black, and then a small square bright blue image (use rick.jpg) aligned at the top right corner. Below that, left aligned, place a large black heading. Underneath, on the left side, have a block of justified black text with some bold and italic emphasis. On the right side, place a "RELATED" heading in uppercase black text, smaller black subheading, and some paragraph text, with a small bright blue rounded-rectangle image (rick.jpg) to the right, all separated from the top text by a thin black horizontal line. Below this section and centered horizontally, place the word "EXPLORE" in uppercase black text. Under "EXPLORE," arrange three bright blue rectangles (rick.jpg) evenly spaced horizontally. Beneath each image is a small uppercase black category label and a short black text title. Below these images, near the bottom of the page, place three columns of text: two with headings in uppercase black followed by body text paragraphs, and one with a rounded black-outlined badge showing a location and time. The footer area has three left-to-right aligned columns with contact info on the left, social links in the center, and a "Contact" label on the right, all in black text. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
