Create a clean, minimalistic webpage with a white background. At the top left, include a horizontal navigation menu with three grey text links: "Papers," "About," and "CV," spaced evenly and aligned horizontally. Below the navigation, place a bold, large black heading "About me." Underneath, add two paragraphs of black, serif body text in a readable size and line spacing, left-aligned with ample white space around. At the bottom left corner of the content area, place two very small, grey, uppercase links labeled "email" and "github.com/benpyle," separated by some space. Use a simple, professional font style throughout. No images are required.
