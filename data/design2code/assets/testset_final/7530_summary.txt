Create a clean, minimalist webpage layout with a predominantly white background. On the left side, place a small vertical navigation menu containing four links in light gray text and a bold, slightly larger heading above it in dark gray. In the center-right, include a main content area with a blue heading for the article title and smaller, light gray body text below arranged in paragraphs and bullet points. At the bottom, add a full-width light gray footer bar containing small, centered dark gray text. Ensure the font is simple and sans-serif for a modern, understated look.
