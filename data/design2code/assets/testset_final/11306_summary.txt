Create a webpage layout with a dark navy header containing a bold white "Feel Greece" logo on the left, a wide search input with placeholder text next to it, and a right-aligned horizontal menu of white text navigation links plus a small UK flag icon dropdown. Below, a breadcrumb navigation uses blue links on the left, followed by a large centered bold page title. Underneath, place a large bright blue rectangle image labeled "rick.jpg" spanning full width with a small white "PHOTOS" tag in the bottom right corner. Below that, a light gray horizontal bar with four evenly spaced bold uppercase blue links (Information, Photos, Map, Hotels). Then a short paragraph of black text content on a white background. Insert a gray cookie consent banner with small text and two buttons: a blue "Ok" and a white "Cancel". Next, create a hotel booking form area with a white background and check-in/out date pickers plus a bright blue search button aligned right. Under that, center a "Photos" heading with six small horizontal bright blue image boxes, the last one darker with "+13 photos" text in white. Then show a "Hotels Nearby" section with a gray background containing two rows of four white cards with hotel names in blue bold, descriptions below in gray text, spaced evenly in a grid layout, and a blue "See all" button centered below. Below that, a "Places Nearby" section with a white background and a horizontally scrollable row of six grayscale gradient image cards labeled in small white uppercase text at the bottom, and a blue "See all" button below. Then a footer-like "More About Pollonia" bar in light gray with the same four blue links aligned center and a "Related Blog Articles" section with three white square cards horizontally spaced, each with a tinted placeholder image, a bold blue article title below, and a smaller gray subtitle line, plus a centered blue "More articles" button beneath. Finally, a dark navy footer with small gray text links horizontally aligned at center and copyright info below. Use clean sans-serif fonts, consistent spacing, and a blue and gray color palette.
