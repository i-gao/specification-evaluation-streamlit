Create a centered card layout on a light gray background. The card should have a white background with subtle rounded corners and light gray border. Inside the card, place a centered blue rectangle image with the source 'rick.jpg' near the top. Below the image, include multiple lines of black paragraph text aligned left with standard sans-serif font. The text lines should have ample spacing between them, and the content area should have comfortable padding around the edges.
