Create a webpage with a light blue background. At the top, place a horizontal navigation bar with the left-aligned text "Chris Boyle" in black and four menu items ("Blog," "CV," "Projects") in darker blue highlight with white text for the active tab. Below the nav bar, include a search bar on the left with a white input field and a blue rectangular button containing a magnifying glass icon. Underneath, place two horizontally aligned blue buttons labeled with emojis and text: a brown box emoji button labeled "APK" and a red octopus emoji button labeled "GitHub." The main content area should have black paragraph text with some code text in red. On the left side under the main paragraph, add "Recent Posts" and a vertical list of post titles in black. Below that, add a "Tags" heading with numerous rectangular tags in lighter blue boxes with gray text arranged in a multi-row block. At the bottom left, include copyright text and a "Credits" link in black with an underline on hover. The font throughout should be a clean sans-serif style.
