Create a clean webpage layout with a white background. Place a small, solid blue square logo in the top-left corner and a small gray text label aligned top-right with the text "Translated Labs." Below, center a wide, light gray rectangular box containing a multiline input textarea with a fine border for user text entry. Underneath the textarea, align a blue rounded rectangle button labeled "Find equilibrium" on the left and smaller, gray text reading "or crash someone else's party" on the right, both inside the gray box. Below this section, align left a block of black text with a label "YOU SAID:" in small uppercase font above a larger paragraph of repeated input text. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
