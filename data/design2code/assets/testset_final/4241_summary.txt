Create a webpage with a dark navy blue top header containing two phone number links in bold white font spaced apart, followed by a bright blue horizontal banner image below it. Below the banner, include a horizontal dark navy blue navigation bar with white uppercase links spaced evenly across. Centered beneath that, place a small label line in black text, then a centered bright blue rectangle image. Below the image, center the machine title in bold black text, accompanied by two smaller bold black subtitle lines. Then include a large centered bright blue rectangular product image below it, followed by a smaller bright blue rectangle image beneath that. Below these images, center two lines of black text with the second line slightly smaller.  

Near the bottom, a muted blue horizontal bar with large white bold left-aligned text reading "Email" and right-aligned bold text for the phone number. Between them, place a centered contact address and company name in white font. Above this bar, place a large dark navy blue rectangular promotions block with white bold heading text and smaller italicized descriptive text lines in white, all centered vertically and horizontally.  

At the bottom footer, use a white background with small black and blue text links placed horizontally spaced along the left side, and a small bright blue rectangular image on the right side. Use simple serif and sans-serif fonts with consistent spacing and alignment on a clean white background except for the navy and blue highlight sections.
