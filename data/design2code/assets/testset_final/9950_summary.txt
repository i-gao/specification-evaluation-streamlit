Create a web page layout with a vibrant blue header bar spanning the top, including a left-aligned rectangular blue image (rick.jpg) as a logo, a large gray search input field centered vertically, and right-aligned bold white navigation links "Browse," "Contribute," and "Community." Below the header, place a light gray notification bar with a small bullet icon and text to the left. The main content area should have a white background and be structured in a multi-column format: On the left side, show a medium blue square image (rick.jpg) labeled with front, back, and more viewing options. To the right of the image, present sections with bold headings in black and subtext in dark gray, arranged horizontally with labels like Released, Credits, Publishers, Developers, Moby Score, Critics, Players, Collected By, Genre, Perspective, Gameplay, and Setting neatly aligned in columns. Include a bordered box on the far right side for Review with star icons and an "Add To Collection" button stacked vertically. Below this, a full-width area presents a bold "Description" heading with standard black text beneath it, followed by a "Groups" section featuring small gray pill-shaped tags with black text and a green plus symbol. Then, a "Screenshots" section shows five evenly spaced small rectangular blue images (rick.jpg) horizontally aligned. Further down, a "Credits" section with bold headings and linked names in blue, separated by thin gray lines. Next, a two-column "Reviews" section: left column with Critic reviews in a table style with bold headings, right column with a player review input box and instructions. Then, a small "Identifiers" section with a green plus symbol and linked text in blue. Following, a "Contribute" section with helper text in black and multiple green text links separated by commas. Finally, a "Contributors to this Entry" section with bold heading and smaller gray text below. The footer should have centered gray text containing site links and copyright info. Use a clean, modern sans-serif font throughout.
