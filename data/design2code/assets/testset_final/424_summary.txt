Create a webpage with a dark gray top header bar spanning full width. On the left side of the header, place the brand name with the first word in blue and the rest in white, and on the right side a white "Menu" text link. Below the header, center a main heading in bold black font, with a subtle light gray subheading below it. The content area underneath should be white with left-aligned paragraph text in light gray. To the right of the paragraphs but aligned vertically with them, include a medium-sized oval-shaped blue image with a thin white border. At the bottom center of the page, add a faint light gray copyright and visitor info line. The overall layout is clean, with a balanced two-column content area and a minimal color palette of dark gray, blue, black, white, and light gray text.
