Create a clean white background webpage with a narrow horizontal red text banner near the top center. Below that, place a left-aligned small grey label "VOTE UP?" next to a bright blue diamond-shaped image (src='rick.jpg'). To the right of the image, add a bold dark blue heading with a name, followed by a black paragraph of text below it. On the far right, place a small dark blue date link aligned vertically with the text. Under the content block, insert a thin horizontal light grey line, then a small right-aligned line of fine print text in dark grey and dark blue links. Below that, place a red rectangular button with white uppercase text "VOTE" aligned left. At the bottom left corner of the page, include three small blue text links spaced horizontally, and a right-aligned copyright line in black on the same footer line. Use a clean serif font for paragraphs and a bold sans-serif font for the heading.
