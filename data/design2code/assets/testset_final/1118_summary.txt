Create a black background page with centered white text. Position a small clickable "Enter using password" link in the top right corner. Center the main heading below near the top, using a serif font in white. Beneath the heading, place an italicized white paragraph with spaced lines. Below that, add a thin white horizontal line. Under the line, include a short white text block describing a mailing list invitation, centered. Below this, add an email input box with placeholder text and a muted green "Join" button to the right inside the same horizontal line. At the bottom center, put a bold white subheading "Spread the word." Below that, place two small blue social media share buttons side by side labeled "f Share" in a dark blue and "T Tweet" in a bright blue. The fonts throughout should be clean and readable.
