Create a webpage with a dark blue background and a top horizontal beige footer bar containing copyright text aligned center. At the very top, place a narrow dark blue navigation bar with small uppercase white text links aligned right. Below, the header area includes a small vertical rectangle on the left with a dotted border and italic beige text above and white text below it. Next to it, horizontally align two lines of white text navigation links in mixed bold and normal weights, separated by slashes, with a dotted line beneath the top line. Below this header navigation section, center a large white content panel slightly rotated with a subtle drop shadow, giving it a layered stacked paper effect. The content panel's top right corner features a small folded corner detail in dark blue and white. Inside this panel, include a bold, navy blue heading with subtle shadow, a pagination line with underlined bold for the current page, and black left-aligned paragraph text styled with small indentations for dialogue format. At the bottom right inside the panel, place bold navigation links for previous and next pages. Use a clean serif font for the main text and a monospace or simple sans for the navigation, with consistent spacing and alignment.
