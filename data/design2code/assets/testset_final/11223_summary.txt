Create a clean, minimal webpage layout with a white background. At the top right, place the header text in a soft pale yellow color and bold font. Below the header, center a simple horizontal navigation menu with small black text and subtle separators between the links. Under the navigation, create a two-column section: a narrow left sidebar with small black text and bold subheadings for categories, and a wider right content area with the main heading in a slightly larger, bold black font, followed by smaller black subheadings and regular paragraph text below each. Keep the fonts modern and simple throughout, with clear spacing and alignment for readability. There are no images in this design.
