The webpage layout features a light gray background with a top navigation bar that includes a blue logo image on the far left, followed by text links spaced horizontally ("Home," "About," "Contact us"). On the top right, there is a white input box next to an orange rectangular button with "fl" text, and two additional text links ("Register" and a gray "Login" button with rounded corners). Below this is a search results section with a prominent heading in black and orange text, followed by a white rounded rectangular container with two-column orange and black text content. A horizontal line separates content sections. Below, a gray section with a light gray background contains a form area including labeled input fields and a dropdown arranged horizontally at the top and a multiline text area below, with an orange rectangular "Post Comment" button aligned to the bottom right. The footer at the bottom uses a dark background with orange headings and white text arranged in three columns, and a small copyright notice centered at the base in white. The overall font is a clean, sans-serif style, and the design uses orange as an accent color on clickable elements and headings.
