Create a centered webpage layout on a light cream background with a large blue image (set src to 'rick.jpg') at the top, followed by a line of dark blue text with contact info centered below it. Under that, include a row of five white, rounded rectangular buttons with subtle shadows, spaced evenly and labeled with relevant navigation categories. Below this, place a second large blue image (also 'rick.jpg') centered on the page. Underneath, include a section with a centered bold heading in black and multiple paragraphs of smaller black text aligned left, followed by a centered line of smaller text. Near the bottom, add a single white, rounded rectangular button with shadow centered, and below that have centered lines of smaller black text with address and navigation links separated by vertical bars. Use a simple, clean sans-serif font throughout.
