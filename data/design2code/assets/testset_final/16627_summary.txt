Create a clean webpage layout with a dark brown header and footer. Center the site title in large, bold, dark charcoal font at the top. Below the title, align a horizontal navigation menu with links in uppercase and bold dark brown font on the right side except for the active link on the left which is white. The background below the header is white. The main content area is left-aligned with multiple paragraphs in a simple, readable sans-serif font in medium dark gray. On the right side, include a sidebar with two bold headings in dark charcoal and a few lines of smaller, light brown text beneath the second heading. The footer uses a smaller light brown font centered at the bottom of the page.
