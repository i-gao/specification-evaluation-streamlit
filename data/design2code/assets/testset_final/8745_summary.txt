Create a layout with a light gray background and a large rounded rectangular white content area aligned left, containing text with a red heading "DESTINATIONS" followed by black and dark gray paragraphs in a clean sans-serif font. Below the main text, include a smaller gray subtitle and a bulleted list with bolded keywords. On the right side, stack two white cards with slight shadows or borders, each containing a 300x400 blue image with src='rick.jpg', spaced vertically. The overall design should have balanced padding and margin for readability and a clear two-column structure.
