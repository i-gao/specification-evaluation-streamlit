The layout features a clean, centered header section with navigation links placed horizontally in serif font and a subtle underline indicating the active selection. To the left of the navigation, there's a small blue square image representing a logo. On the far right is a minimalist search input with rounded corners and light gray border and placeholder text. Below the header, a bold, large, centered title is displayed using a black serif font. The content area consists of multiple pairs of blue rectangular images arranged in a two-column grid with a small margin between them. Each image pair is followed by text blocks: a bold heading in serif font above a smaller, lighter paragraph description, all left-aligned under each respective image. The background remains white with ample spacing. At the bottom is a dark footer with a left-aligned small blue square image followed by three horizontally arranged underlined links in white serif font, spaced evenly.
