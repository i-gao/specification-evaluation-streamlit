Create a clean web layout with a white background. On the left side, place a vertical navigation menu with four blue text links, each in bold: "Algorithms and Computational Biology," "Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems," "Databases & Data Mining," and "Networks and Communications." Centered horizontally near the top and slightly right of the navigation menu, add a bold, underlined heading in dark gray for "News & Announcements." Below this heading, aligned left, include multiple lines of dark gray body text in bold with some spacing between paragraphs. The font should be a simple sans-serif style for clarity. The layout should remain uncluttered, with ample whitespace around text elements.
