Please create a clean, white-background webpage with a top header containing a small blue square logo on the left and a simple horizontal navigation menu on the right with black text links. Below the header, include a thin horizontal dark gray divider line spanning the width. The main content area is divided into two columns: the left column (larger) with dark blue bold heading text and two paragraphs in black font, followed by a medium blue subheading and two bulleted blue links. The right column has a vertical gray dividing line and a grid of seven blue rectangular images labeled below in black text, arranged in three rows of two images each, except the last row with one image centered. Use a standard sans-serif font for all text. The footer is a dark gray bar with lighter gray text aligned left and right. The blue rectangles represent images with src 'rick.jpg'.
