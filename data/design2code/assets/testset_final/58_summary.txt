Create a clean webpage layout with a white background and black text. At the top left, display a small textual logo "shop ireland .ie" in black with "ireland" bolded. Next to it, center a white search bar with rounded corners and placeholder text, followed by a bright blue dropdown button labeled "Music" with white text. Below this, add breadcrumb navigation links in blue text. Under the breadcrumbs, place a medium-sized bright blue rectangular image placeholder on the left. To the right of the image, show a large, bold black heading. Below the heading, include a light gray rectangular button with black text. Below that, align small black text lines with some blue hyperlink text. Underneath, add black subheadings with bullet lists in black text, and some nested bullet details. At the bottom, include several lines of small blue hyperlink text horizontally centered, separated by line breaks and with bold text for a "See all stores" link. Finally, add a grey copyright line with smaller grey disclaimers and legal text below. The overall font should be a clean, modern sans-serif.
