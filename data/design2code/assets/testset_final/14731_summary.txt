Create a web page with a black background and a narrow black header area containing a white text title aligned left. Below the header, place a centered white content box with padding, containing a left-aligned bold heading in larger font followed by multiple paragraphs of black text in a clean, readable sans-serif font. The content box ends with a thin dotted horizontal divider line. At the bottom, include a narrow black footer area with centered, small, gray text. The page should have a clean, minimalistic style with consistent spacing and alignment.
