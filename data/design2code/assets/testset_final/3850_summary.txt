Create a clean, white webpage with a narrow shadowed container in the center. At the top left, display the title in bold blue uppercase serif font with a small bright orange subtitle underneath. Below that, have a dark horizontal navigation bar with white uppercase links for Home, Consultancy, About, and Contact, separated by a thin bright orange line. Below the nav, place a bold black heading for the article title with date and author metadata in smaller gray text on the left. Then a horizontal black bar labeled "Page Content" followed by a four-row white content box with bright orange bold links and thin gray separators. Below that, a large rectangular area filled with solid bright blue as an image placeholder. Then below the image, multiple sections of black bold subheadings with smaller black paragraph text aligned left. At the bottom, include left and right aligned bold navigation links with small supporting text, and a dark gray footer bar spanning the width with subtle white text. The fonts should be consistent with serif for headings and small sans-serif for the metadata and paragraphs.
