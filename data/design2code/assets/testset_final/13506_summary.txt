Create a webpage with a black horizontal navigation bar at the top containing four white text links spaced evenly: "Home," "Events," "Photos," and "Music." Below the navigation bar, center a light blue hyperlink. Underneath the link, place a row of four equally sized bright blue square images side-by-side with no spacing between them. The background of the page is white and the navigation bar corners are slightly rounded. The page uses a clean, sans-serif font. The images should have their src attribute set to 'rick.jpg'.
