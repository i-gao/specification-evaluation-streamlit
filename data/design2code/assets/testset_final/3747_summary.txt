The webpage layout features a horizontal turquoise navigation bar at the top with white bold links spaced evenly: "schedule," "the artists," "the curators," and "press." Below is a white content area with black text, organized in a clean, readable serif and sans-serif font mix, including bold headings and smaller red subheadings. Event details are grouped with spacing and include black text addresses and turquoise hyperlinks. The footer has a black background with four evenly spaced rectangular blue images (src='rick.jpg'). Below these images is white and turquoise text with hyperlinks, aligned left, and arranged in small paragraphs, contact info, and credits. The overall design is minimalist with clear sectioning, consistent typography, and a contrasting footer.
