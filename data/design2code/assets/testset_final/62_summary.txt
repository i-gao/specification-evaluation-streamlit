Create a clean webpage layout with a white background and blue accent elements. In the top-left corner, position a large square image (src='rick.jpg') in bright blue. Align four small square blue images in a row near the top-right corner, followed by language selection links ("DE | EN") in black text on the right. Below this, add a horizontal blue bar spanning the full width with centered bold white text. Underneath, place a breadcrumb breadcrumb navigation line with a small blue square image on the left side. Then, present the main content area with a black bold heading and justified paragraph text in a standard serif font. The footer section is dark gray with white text, arranged vertically with multiple links spaced evenly. Below the footer, show a copyright note in gray and two rectangular bright blue images stacked vertically on the left side, with a small gray text label above the second image. Ensure consistent spacing and alignment for a balanced, professional look.
