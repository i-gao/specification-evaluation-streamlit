Create a clean, two-column web layout with a narrow left sidebar and a wider main content area. The header features a horizontal coral-colored banner spanning the page width with the site title in light text aligned left, and a subtle tagline beneath. Below the header, place a horizontal navigation bar with four text links evenly spaced. The left main column has a white background with black text for headings and paragraphs, using a clean, sans-serif font. The right sidebar, narrower, includes two headings with grey text and smaller descriptive text underneath, separated by dotted lines. Footer at the bottom is a muted red-brown rectangle with white, small text left and right aligned. The overall style is minimal, with ample white space and subtle division lines.
