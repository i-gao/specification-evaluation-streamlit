The layout features a white background with a subtle light grey outer margin and is divided into a main central section and a right sidebar. The header includes a large blue square image on the left (src='rick.jpg') and four smaller blue square images aligned horizontally to the right, accompanied by a small search bar with a white input field and a grey "Search" button aligned right. Below the header is a horizontal light grey navigation bar with four navigation links spaced evenly: Home, Archives, About, and Mailing List, all in bold black font. The main content area on the left has a bold black section heading and a series of small colored square icons in blue, black, green, and light green beneath it, followed by body text in a clean serif font in black. Comments are displayed in a structured table with alternating light purple backgrounds for rows, featuring bold black headings on a black background. The right sidebar is separated by a thin black vertical line and includes "Related Items," a section labeled "ADVERTISEMENT" centered in grey uppercase text, and two separate lists labeled "Newest" and "Most Popular," each with small bullet points and blue text links. The footer area contains centralized text disclaimers and navigation links in small black font separated by vertical bars on a white background. Overall, the layout uses black and blue as primary accent colors with clean, sharp edges and a structured multi-column format.
