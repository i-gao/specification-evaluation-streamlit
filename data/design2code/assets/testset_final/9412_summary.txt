Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background. At the top, center a brownish-gray, uppercase heading in a bold, condensed sans-serif font. Directly below, place a light gray horizontal navigation bar with subtle brownish text links spaced evenly across the width. Centered beneath the navigation, include a large, bold rectangular blue image placeholder (source 'rick.jpg'). Below the image, center a bold, uppercase heading in the same brownish-gray font with a thin horizontal line underneath. Below that, stack contact information in small, black, center-aligned text with subtle gray subtext for redacted details. To the left side under this section, place a small rectangular button with beige background and dark text, featuring uppercase bold letters. Next, create a wide light gray horizontal section with a centered bold uppercase heading in brownish-gray font, a thin horizontal line beneath, and three stacked text blocks describing mission, vision, and values. The values contain bold initial letters for each principle. Finally, create a footer on a slightly darker gray background with centered small black text lines for address, phone, copyright, and website builder credits. Use clean, sans-serif fonts throughout with consistent margin spacing.
