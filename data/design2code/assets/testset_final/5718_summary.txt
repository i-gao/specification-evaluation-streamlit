Create a webpage with a top horizontal navigation bar in a warm orange color (#E3A75E). On the left side of this bar, place a blue rectangular logo image with src 'rick.jpg'. Next to the logo, include navigation links in a clean sans-serif font colored in dark gray, spaced evenly: Home, Search (with a dropdown arrow), Browse, and Tools & Resources. On the right side of the navigation bar, add a white rounded search input field with placeholder text and a white rectangular search button with a subtle border and rounded corners. Below the nav bar, center the page title in a medium-large black font with horizontal spacing between words. Underneath, place a full-width light beige info box with a subtle border and rounded corners containing bold black headers followed by regular text and some inline colored link buttons in a soft orange shade. The body background is white with plenty of white space. At the bottom left corner of the page, place small blue hyperlinked text for citation and terms of use, and on the bottom right corner, add black informational text with a blue hyperlink. The overall layout is clean, minimal, and uses subtle colored highlights for interactive elements.
