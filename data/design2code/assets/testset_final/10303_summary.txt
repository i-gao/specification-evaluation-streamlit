Please create a clean, white background webpage with a header containing a left-aligned rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg') in blue and a right-aligned horizontal navigation menu with uppercase, small-spaced text links spaced evenly: HOUSEHOLD, GIFTS, PAPER, HOLIDAY. Below the header, show a left-aligned heading "Easter Baskets" in black, followed by a large horizontal rectangular blue image ('rick.jpg') centered below it. Under the image, include a short paragraph of body text aligned left. The footer has a dark teal background with four columns: the first column includes a small square blue image ('rick.jpg') on top and below that, address text in white. The next three columns each have uppercase subheadings in smaller white font and lists of links or text below in white with generous spacing. At the bottom, add a thin border line and a final smaller text line in white. Use simple, clean sans-serif fonts with consistent spacing and alignment throughout.
