Create a clean webpage layout with a white background. At the top, place a left-aligned blue rectangle image sized about a small logo and a horizontally centered navigation menu with four blue text links separated by thin vertical lines. Below that, include a large bright blue rectangular banner spanning most of the page width. Under the banner, add a section with a bold dark blue heading followed by two paragraphs of smaller, gray body text aligned to the left. At the bottom, include a wide dark blue footer containing small white text on the left and bold white contact info right-aligned, with the footer corners slightly rounded. Use a sans-serif font throughout. The top blue rectangle and banner should be images with src set to 'rick.jpg'.
