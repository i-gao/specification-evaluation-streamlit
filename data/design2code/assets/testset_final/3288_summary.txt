Create a webpage with a bright purple header spanning the full width, containing white text for the logo on the left, a white search bar with a yellow "Search" button in the center, and a login link in lighter purple on the right. Below the header, place a white section with a headline in purple and smaller black subtext. Below that, have a two-column layout over a light gray background: the left column is wider and displays multiple white rectangular question cards stacked vertically, each featuring a circular blue avatar on the left, grey username text next to it, the question text in black, small gray rounded badges with time info on bottom left, and category labels in pastel blue and pink top-right, with a purple outlined "Answers" button on the right-bottom corner of each card. Pagination buttons "Previous" and "Next" appear below the cards in purple outlined style. The right sidebar, narrower and with a white background and subtle border radius, lists "Subjects" and "Grades" with purple links and small purple pill-shaped counters aligned on the right side of each item. The footer uses the same bright purple background as the header with small white text links centered horizontally, followed by a thin white horizontal line and copyright text below in white. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
