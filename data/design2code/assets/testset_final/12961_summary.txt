Create a web layout with a bright yellow header containing two blue rectangular images side by side, the left smaller and the right larger, both centered horizontally. Below that, include a black horizontal navigation bar with white text menu items and a blue highlight for the active dropdown item. The main content area is dark gray with a white card on the left containing the article title in bold dark gray, meta information in smaller muted gold text, and black body text. To the right, place a dark gray sidebar with white section headers and bright yellow links for latest posts, archives, and tags. Below the article, add a comment section with bold white headings and dark gray background forms and fields. Finally, a dark footer bar with muted gray text and a blue highlighted email link is included.
