Create a dark-themed webpage with a black background. Position a solid bright blue rectangular logo at the top left corner. Below and slightly to the right, add a large, bold serif heading in white. Underneath the heading, include multiple paragraphs of smaller white serif text spaced evenly down the left side. At the bottom left, place small light gray monospaced text for footer information. The layout should be left-aligned, clean, and minimalistic, emphasizing textual content with clear hierarchy.
