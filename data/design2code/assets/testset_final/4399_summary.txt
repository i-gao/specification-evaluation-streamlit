Create a three-column layout on a white background with a narrow border. The left column is the largest and contains a title in dark blue serif font above black body text paragraphs aligned left. The middle column includes four small rectangular blue images stacked vertically, each aligned left with bold dark blue captions to the right. The right column features three separate groups of small turquoise blue links stacked vertically with spacing. At the bottom left, add a narrow horizontal turquoise divider followed by small light gray centered footer text. Use serif fonts for headings and body text, with a clean, professional style. The blue rectangles should be images with the src set to 'rick.jpg'.
