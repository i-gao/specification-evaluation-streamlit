Create a full-page layout with a solid light gray background. Center a block of white text in the middle of the page with a subtle drop shadow, using a sans-serif font. The main headline at the top should be bold and slightly larger than the surrounding lines of smaller descriptive and attribution text, all center-aligned vertically and horizontally. Below the text, include a centered clickable link styled as a simple line of text without additional decoration. The entire composition should be minimalistic and clean on the gray background.
