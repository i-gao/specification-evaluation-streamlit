Create a web layout with a dark charcoal header containing white main title text on the left and smaller brown subtitle text below it. On the right side of this header, place two small bold grey navigation links separated by a vertical line. Below the header, add a wide horizontal grey navigation bar with four bold, light beige text links spaced evenly. The main content area uses a very light grey background, with a two-column layout: left column has a large dark gray heading and a bright blue subheading link in a larger font below it, followed by smaller dark grey paragraph text and a large bright blue rectangular image placeholder beneath. Under this image, place three small underline blue action links with vertical separators. The right column features a large bright blue rectangular image placeholder, taller than the left column image. Below these columns, a horizontal rule is followed by two side-by-side sections titled in large dark grey text that aligns left and right, each with smaller light grey underline links to the side. Under each title, bullet points of black text content appear with standard spacing on a white background. Finally, a wide grey footer bar spans the bottom with small white text links on the left and right, and a darker grey bar below containing small grey copyright and privacy text left-aligned and a small website credit right-aligned. Use clean, sans-serif fonts throughout.
