The webpage layout features a white header with a blue square image on the top left. To the right of the image, green text provides a question and phone number in a clean sans-serif font. Below the header is a full-width green navigation bar with white centered menu links and a yellow search button containing an icon, aligned to the right. A breadcrumb navigation line with smaller text sits below this bar on a light blue background. The main content area is a white background with a left-aligned block of black body text, headings in a medium-weight sans-serif font, and a right sidebar containing a pale green box with a bold green heading, a yellow call-to-action button, and a white form with green submit button. Below the main content is a light gray wide section with dark gray text and green hyperlink text. The footer uses a darker green background with a blue square image on the left and white text next to it, followed by a bottom-most dark green strip containing smaller white navigation links in four columns and copyright text below. The fonts throughout are clean and modern sans-serif, with a consistent green color palette for highlights and calls to action.
