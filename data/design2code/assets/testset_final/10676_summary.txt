Create a web page with an olive green gradient background. At the top right, place a horizontal navigation menu with four white text links spaced evenly: Home, About, Contact, and Construction, separated from the content below by a thin horizontal line. On the left side below this, include a section with a bold white heading and several lines of smaller white body text underneath, aligned left and spaced well. On the right side, place a rectangular image with a subtle shadow effect, sized prominently, with the image source set to 'rick.jpg'. The font should be clean and sans-serif.
