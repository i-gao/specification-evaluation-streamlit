Create a webpage with a light gray (#c6c7b9) background and a main container centered on the page. At the top, place a large rectangular image (src='rick.jpg') spanning the full width of the container in bright blue. Below this, add a horizontal beige (#c5a56f) navigation bar with four left-aligned text links in small, serif font, colored in a muted brown. Under the bar, create a two-column layout: the left column is a vertical stack of five equally sized dark blue images (src='rick.jpg') separated by thin horizontal lines, while the right column is a narrow sidebar containing a smaller dark blue image (src='rick.jpg') at the top, followed by text in a small, serif, brown font with various headings in bold and some horizontal divider lines. The page footer is a light beige block with a thin horizontal line above it, containing centered, small, italicized brown text with additional navigation links below, spaced vertically. Ensure consistent spacing and alignments as shown.
