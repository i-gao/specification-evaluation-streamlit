Create a blog layout with a soft pink background. At the top left, place the blog title in a classic serif font with large size, and beneath it a smaller tagline in a simple sans-serif font. Align a "SEARCH" link to the top right. Below that, include a wide horizontal dark olive-brown bar containing text and a bold right-aligned link. Then, display blog posts in a two-column masonry grid with a small gap between them. Odd posts are dark olive-brown rectangles with white textâ€”date in small uppercase, title in serif bold, and share/comment links in small gray text. Even posts use bright blue rectangular images (use 'rick.jpg' as the src) with a small date label over the bottom left corner, and below the image, the title in bold serif with share/comment links in small black text. At the bottom right, place a small "OLDER POSTS" link in black. The footer includes subtle gray text centered at the bottom. Ensure consistent spacing between elements and align text flush left except for top right items.
