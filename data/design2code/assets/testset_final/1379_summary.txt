Create a web page with a dark charcoal header containing the main title in large, light gray font and a smaller subtitle in muted brown below it, aligned left. On the top right of this header, place small, light gray navigation links for Contact, F.A.Q, and Donate, separated by vertical bars. Below the header, add a medium gray horizontal navigation bar with bold, light beige text links labeled Home, Products, News, and Awards aligned left. The main content area should have a white background with a centered bold heading "Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q):" in dark gray. Below this heading, alternate sections of FAQ content in rectangular boxes with thin bordersâ€”some boxes in pale yellow with dark gold text and others in light green with dark green text, all containing a bold question line followed by a smaller explanatory text. At the bottom, include a light gray footer bar containing links Home, Products, News, Awards, Contacts, and Donate in small white font left-aligned, with a small "Top ^" on the right side. Finally, below the footer, a narrow darker gray strip with small gray credits text. The entire layout should use clean, sans-serif fonts with clear spacing and alignment.
