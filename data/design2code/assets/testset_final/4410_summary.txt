Create a two-column webpage layout with a white background and grey footer. At the top left, place a bright blue rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg') with a short caption below. Top right corner has small black navigation links horizontally aligned (About, Contact, Forum, Help). Below the header is a pale blue horizontal navigation bar with four equal sections labeled in small grey-blue font. Left column below the nav bar features a series of blocks: a light green heading with bold text, a pale blue heading, a beige informational box with small text, a download section with four dark green rectangular buttons stacked vertically, a production details block with textual info, and finally a block of blue links. The right column is wider and begins with a beige info box containing a bold dark grey title, a smaller blue link below, and black paragraph text, alongside a bright blue rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg') floated right with two small blue download links below it. Underneath is a pale blue table header row with three columns and below it, three alternating light blue and off-white rows containing chapter data with bold blue headings for chapters and readers in blue text, aligned horizontally with times in black text on the right. The footer is a horizontal grey bar with a small bright blue square image (src 'rick.jpg') aligned left inside it. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
