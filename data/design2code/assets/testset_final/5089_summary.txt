Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a white background. At the top left corner, include a simple horizontal navigation menu with three black text links spaced evenly: WORK, PLAY, and ABOUT, using a small, sans-serif font. Centered below the menu, add a bold, slightly larger header in black text. Underneath, place a small gray subtitle. Below that, display two large side-by-side images with the source set to 'rick.jpg', each occupying about half the width with a small gap between them. Beneath the images, center three lines of small black paragraph text with normal weight and ample white space around them. Finally, at the very bottom center of the page, add faint, light gray footer text in a small font. On the right side in the middle, include a subtle gray circular button. The typography should be modern and clean, with consistent spacing and alignment for a sleek, structured look.
