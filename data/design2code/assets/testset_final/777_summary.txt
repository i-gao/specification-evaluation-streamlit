Create a clean webpage layout with a light gray header area at the top containing two lines of text in dark gray: a larger line with “You have reached NFC’s publication archives” and a smaller subtitle below it. Below, place the main content area with left-aligned black text on a white background, including headings, paragraphs, bullet points, and a table styled simply with borders and bold headers. The table should have four rows and two columns, with the first column text bolded and the second column with regular text. Use italic styling for certain captions like "Summary," "Tax Formula," "Resources," and "Inquiries" around the content sections. The overall font should be a clean sans-serif style, with consistent spacing and indentation for lists and text blocks, producing a professional and readable document-style webpage.
