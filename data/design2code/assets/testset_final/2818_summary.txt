Create a clean, minimalist layout with a white background and dark gray text. On the top left, place the site title "Harlem CORE" in a large, serif font. Below that on the left sidebar, include a small search box with a label "Search" above it and a subtle "Advanced Search" link beneath. Under the search area, add a vertical navigation menu with three text links: "Browse Items," "Browse Collections," and "Browse Exhibits," with "Browse Items" highlighted in bold and preceded by a small dark gray square icon. To the right of the sidebar, center the main content area with a bold section title "Browse Items (4 total)" and a horizontal tab menu below it featuring two tabs: a bold "Browse All" tab with a subtle gray underline and a "Browse by Tag" tab in lighter text. Then display four item listings stacked vertically with each containing a small 100x100 pixel bright blue square image to the left and descriptive text to the right. Each item's title is bold and slightly larger, with tags labeled in smaller bold text beneath the description. Separate each listing with a thin horizontal line. At the bottom, add a simple footer with the text "Proudly powered by Omeka" on the left and a horizontal menu with the three navigation items "Home," "Browse Items," "Browse Collections," and "Browse Exhibits" spaced evenly. Use a consistent serif font throughout for all text with subtle gray lines for dividing content.
