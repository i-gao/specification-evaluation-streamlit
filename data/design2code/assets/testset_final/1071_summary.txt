The layout features a clean, minimalist white background with black serif fonts for the main title and post headings. At the top left is the blog title in large black serif font, with a smaller gray tagline beneath it. To the top right is a small green "SEARCH" link. Below the title on the left side is a small green "Share" link aligned horizontally. The main content column, centered horizontally, contains a small gray date above bold black post titles, followed by a thin black horizontal line. Below each title is a large rectangular image (use 'rick.jpg' as the src) in bright blue as a placeholder. Beneath the image, the post text appears in black with some green inline links. Another green "Share" link is placed under the post content. Further down, a "COMMENTS" section appears in gray. On the right side, under "POPULAR POSTS" in gray, are two stacked blog post previews each with a gray date, large blue rectangular image, bold black title, and small green links underneath. The overall design uses white space generously with simple line dividers and consistent use of green for links. The bottom center includes small gray text "Powered by Blogger."
