Create a webpage with a top black notification bar containing small white text. Below it, have a white horizontal navigation bar with the left-aligned bold title "KLS CRETE, INC." and right-aligned navigation links: Home (underlined), Contact Us, Services, and Photo Gallery in black font. The main hero section beneath uses a solid deep blue background with a large centered white bold heading and a thin horizontal line below it. Below the line, place a small white-outlined rectangular button labeled "Contact Us" centered horizontally. The content section below has a white background with the heading "ABOUT US" aligned left in bold uppercase black text, followed by a thin horizontal line. Below, place a two-row, two-column grid: top-left and bottom-right cells contain large square images loaded from 'rick.jpg' in deep blue, and the top-right and bottom-left cells contain centered black text blocks with bold subheadings and smaller bold paragraphs. After that, a wide horizontal light gray band spans full width. The footer below is white with thin horizontal lines separating sections and centered small gray text for copyright and branding at the bottom. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
