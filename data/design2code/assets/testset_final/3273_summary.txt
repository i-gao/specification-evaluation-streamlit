Create a web page with a dark gray horizontal header bar across the top containing a bright blue square logo aligned left. Below the header, place the main content area on a white background. On the left side under the heading "Inflation on $966," include a light gray form box with labeled input fields and dropdowns for amount, from year, and to year, plus a bright blue rectangular button labeled "Calculate Inflation." To the right of this form, display a text line with blue and black inline links. Below, arrange two columns: on the left a light gray informational text box with paragraphs, on the right a simple table with a header row and data rows in alternating light gray background. Beneath these columns, show a multi-column list with labels inside light gray rectangular boxes aligned horizontally in four groups of four items each, all left aligned. Use a clean sans-serif font for all text. Finally, add a light gray footer bar with several subtle inline text links aligned left at the bottom.
