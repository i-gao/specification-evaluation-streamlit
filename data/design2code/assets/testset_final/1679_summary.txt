Create a clean, minimalistic webpage layout with a white background and black text. At the top left corner, place a simple site logo or name "nLab" in a plain font. Just below that, center a horizontal navigation bar with small, underlined links in grey font for "Skip the Navigation Links," "Home Page," "All Pages," "Latest Revisions," and "Discuss this page." Align a small search box with rounded corners to the right side of this navigation bar. The main content area should have a large, bold heading for the person's name centered near the top. Below it, present content in a simple, left-aligned paragraph style using standard serif fonts in black and dark green for clickable links. Use bullet points for lists and emphasize some text with italics. The bottom of the page includes a small footer with grey text links for editing options and revision history in a single line, aligned center. The overall layout is spacious, clean, and easy to read, with no excessive colors or graphics.
