Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a white background container featuring subtle rounded corners and a light grey border. On the top left inside the container, place a bold heading with smaller instructional text beneath it, using a simple sans-serif font in dark grey. To the right, arrange a grid of blue rectangular image placeholders (each labeled with white text) in multiple rows and three columns, with consistent spacing around them; images should use the source 'rick.jpg'. Below the images, incorporate a small pagination bar with numbered boxes, the active page highlighted in grey. On the left side below the text block, include a newsletter subscription input field styled minimally with a grey border and small fine print disclaimer below it. At the bottom outside the main container, include a wide light beige footer with three evenly spaced columns, each with a bold heading and several small grey hyperlinks beneath, aligned left. Finally, add a centered footer note in small grey text below the beige footer. Use subtle grey for secondary text and maintain a clean, minimalist aesthetic throughout.
