Create a clean, centered webpage layout with a white background and a maximum width container. At the top, place a bold black heading aligned left with a smaller subtitle below in normal font. Below that, include a horizontal navigation menu with a thin black border line under it. The menu items "Home," "Search," "Subscribe," "Suggest," and "About" are spaced horizontally; the active "Home" tab is enclosed in a thin black rectangle box. Beneath the navigation, on the left side, position a small square blue image (src="rick.jpg"). Next to it on the right, place a large rectangular blue image (src="rick.jpg"). Below the large image, include a block of left-aligned text paragraphs with some bold text highlighting a username. At the bottom, separated by a thin horizontal black line, include a small footer text line. Use a clean, sans-serif font throughout.
