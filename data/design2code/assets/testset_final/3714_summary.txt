Create a webpage with a white background featuring a large rectangular image at the top-left in bright blue (source 'rick.jpg'). Below it, place a horizontal navigation bar with a gradient dark blue to purple background and white text for menu items aligned left. Centered below the navbar, add a bold heading in a dark blue serif font with a smaller black subheading beneath it. Below these headings, insert a main content area with two white cards side by side: the left card contains a smaller bright blue image above centered text in black and blue links, while the right card stacks two smaller white boxes vertically with small bright blue images and blocks of black text with blue hyperlinks. At the bottom, add a footer with a similar gradient dark blue to purple background containing a rectangular bright blue image on the left and small black text aligned right, including a small blue hyperlink. Use clean, readable sans-serif fonts throughout.
