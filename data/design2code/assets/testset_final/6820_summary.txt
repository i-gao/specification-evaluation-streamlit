Create a web page layout with a narrow horizontal dark navy blue top navigation bar containing three menu items aligned left: a small triangular bullet icon followed by "Home," "Hobbies," and "Health" in bold, small yellow text. Below that, a wide horizontal section in light yellow spans the page width with a left-aligned block containing a black, bolded heading and a smaller subheading link in blue. The main content area beneath is centered and off-white with paragraphs of dark gray text, including bullet points and embedded small colored boxes labeled "TIP" in pale yellow with a thin yellow border, and "WARNING" in pale orange with an orange border, each containing smaller text. The bottom footer spans full width with a light yellow background split into three vertical columns separated by a thin vertical line. The left column has smaller dark yellow text, the middle column has black text links aligned left, and the right column has a bold black "Legal" heading above three black link items stacked vertically. A faint gray copyright notice is centered in a narrow horizontal band below the footer content. Use a clean sans-serif font throughout.
