Please create a clean, centered white content box with black bold headers and standard black body text on a white background. At the top center, place two gray rectangular buttons side by side labeled "Go Back" and "Print." Below that, include three checkboxes with black labels horizontally aligned. Beneath the checkboxes, place a horizontal group with a dark gray minus button, a white input box with black text, and a dark gray plus button, followed by black text. Next, include three rectangular font size buttons labeled "Smaller," "Normal," and "Larger," with the "Normal" button highlighted in dark gray with white text. Below, present the recipe content with multiple bold section headers, black bullet points, and a blue hyperlink. The entire content area should have ample white space and a clean, readable sans-serif font. At the bottom center, place a small gray footer text.
