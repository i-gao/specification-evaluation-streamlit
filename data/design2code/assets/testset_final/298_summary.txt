Create a clean, minimal blog layout on a light cream background. At the top, place a very thin horizontal line in pale yellow beneath a small logo area on the left in teal, with three magenta navigation links to its right, and two small teal icons aligned right. The main content area uses dark brown body text with headings in bold dark charcoal. Links in teal and magenta highlight text in some places. Small star icons in pale yellow separate sections. The item titles in the list use teal, with book titles in italics. Below the main content, a narrow pale yellow horizontal rule separates a two-column link navigation area in teal: left aligned for previous posts, right aligned for next posts, with dates below in smaller font. Then a heading in dark brown and a list of additional links in teal with smaller descriptions below in a lighter teal shade. The footer is also separated by a pale yellow horizontal line, with two columns of small orange links and labels in dark brown. Finally, a small orange credit bar is centered at the bottom. Use a simple sans serif font for the body, with some bold and italic emphasis, and keep generous white space around paragraphs.
