Create a webpage layout with a wide horizontal navigation bar at the top in dark navy blue with a thin white stripe underneath, followed by a large dark navy blue rectangular hero section centered on the page. Inside the hero, place a small rounded rectangle dark navy label near the top-left corner with white and light blue text, and below that a two-line heading in white serif font reading "Your best friend for file transfer." At the bottom of the hero section, add a thin underline below a small uppercase blue link aligned left. Beneath the hero, center a narrower content area with a discussion forum style layout on a white background. Display a forum thread title in uppercase dark navy bold font with a gray post count next to it, followed by a rectangular salmon-colored alert box with faint red border containing muted red text. Below, show meta info in small gray text with bullet points, then a vertical sequence of user posts separated by faint gray horizontal lines. Each post has the username on the left in bold dark gray and role underneath in smaller gray, with the post content to the right in smaller black serif text and timestamps beneath in light gray uppercase. On the right side of posts, add a small subtle link marker (#) in gray. The entire page background is white with a footer line centered at the bottom in small uppercase gray text. Use serif fonts for the main text and a clean sans serif style for the header and links. The page width should be moderate with plenty of white space around content.
