Create a clean, structured webpage featuring a top horizontal cookie consent bar with grey background, black text, a green "OK" button on the left, and a "Close" button on the right. Below this, a header area with a left-aligned blue square image (src 'rick.jpg'), a white search box with subtle border, and a top horizontal navigation menu on the right with grey and bold black text for selected item. Below header, a breadcrumb in light grey background with green and grey text links. The main content area is a white card with subtle drop shadows, containing a left vertical navigation menu with light grey borders and a green highlight on the active item. The right main content area uses green headings and dark grey body text with some green links, laid out with ample white space. The background behind the card features a subtle green gradient. At the bottom, a footer with a dark grey background and white text, including three small blue square icons (src 'rick.jpg') in the center above the footer links, and footer text aligned centrally. Font style is clean and modern, with green used as the primary accent color for headings, links, and active states.
