Create a clean, minimalist webpage with a light gray horizontal header bar at the top spanning the full width. Center a bold, black headline in large font within this bar. Below the headline, include a small horizontal breadcrumb navigation line with blue clickable links spaced by slashes, aligned center within the header. The main body should have a white background with black left-aligned paragraph text spaced evenly. At the bottom, center a small footer line with blue clickable links separated by dashes and a simple copyright notice in black. Use a standard sans-serif font throughout.
