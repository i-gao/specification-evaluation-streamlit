Create a centered dark gray rectangular box on a light gray background. Inside the box, place a white bold heading text underlined near the top. Below the heading, include a smaller regular white text line, followed by a white rectangular input field with a black border. To the right of the input field, add a gray rectangular button with bold black text. The box should have a subtle shadow or border to distinguish it from the background. Use a clean, sans-serif font for all text.
