Create a web page layout with a light gray background. Center a white content box with a thin black border. At the top and near the bottom of this box, add wide horizontal light gray bars. In the top bar, center bold black text in a medium font size. Below, fill the main white area with left-aligned black body text in a small font size, spaced into paragraphs. At the bottom light gray bar, place a horizontal menu with evenly spaced black text links (Home, About, Finance Clients, Project Finance, Charges, Contact), centered horizontally. Beneath the bottom bar, center a small copyright notice in black text.
