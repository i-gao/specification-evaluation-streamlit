Create a web layout with a top horizontal bar featuring a welcome message on the left and two rounded rectangular buttons ("Log in" and "Sign up") in blue gradients on the right, followed by a search input field, a dropdown, and a search button aligned horizontally. Below this is a large blue rectangular image placeholder. Under the image is a large white rounded rectangle container with a subtle border and shadow, containing a small date/time text top-left and a news section top-right with bold heading and link styled in black and blue. Inside the container is a horizontal navigation bar with an orange gradient "Home" button on the left and plain text links ("Search," "Calendar") next to it. Below that is a narrow white bar with a faint border. Centered inside the container is a smaller white box with rounded corners and a blue gradient header containing bold white text for "Warning!" Then below is explanatory text in grey with a bold link. Below is another similar-sized white box with a blue gradient header reading "Log in" and a login form containing aligned bold labels and input fields for username and password, a dropdown for "Time to stay logged in," a light gray "LOG IN" button, and a small clickable "Forgot your password?" link. At the bottom, a full-width dark blue footer with small white text on the left and corner-right aligned white links. The fonts should be sans-serif, primarily in black or dark grey, with consistent spacing and alignment.
