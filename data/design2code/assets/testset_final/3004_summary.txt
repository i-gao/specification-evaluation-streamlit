Create a minimalistic webpage with a white background and a top horizontal navigation bar. On the left of the navbar, place the site name in thin black uppercase letters and a small dark gray rectangular label with white uppercase text next to it. On the right, align menu items in thin black uppercase font with the active item in bright pink. Below the navbar on the left, include a small black rectangular label with white uppercase text above several lines of left-aligned descriptive text in a clean sans-serif font in dark gray. To the right of this text block, place a large rectangular image in bright blue with the src set to 'rick.jpg.' Beneath this, horizontally align four smaller blue squares spaced evenly. Below those squares, center a large black video player placeholder with white error text inside. At the bottom center of the page, place the same navigation menu as in the top but in smaller bright pink text, with a copyright line below in small dark gray text. The overall typography should be thin and modern, primarily in uppercase except for descriptive text.
