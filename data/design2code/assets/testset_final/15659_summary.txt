Create a webpage with a white background and a two-column layout. On the left, place a narrow vertical sidebar with the "EmInf" logo in dark gold, styled with a serif font and spaced-out smaller text underneath. Below the logo, include a bold sidebar menu with small, uppercase, dark gold and black links separated by dotted horizontal lines. The sidebar should have categories with bold headings and sub-links in a monospaced typewriter font, all in black or dark gold. On the right, position the main content area with a top horizontal navigation menu in small uppercase dark gold text spaced evenly. Below it, have a bold dark gold heading. Present the main text in black with clear line spacing. Include a data table outlined with a thin dark brown border, featuring month headers in a light orange background and bold dark orange text. The table cells alternate with subtle beige shading for some rows and contain small, colorful numeric data in various highlight colors like blue and red. The footer spans both columns with very small uppercase dark gold text aligned left and right. The overall font scheme: serif for headings, monospaced and sans-serif for text and menus, colors mainly dark gold (#bb9800), black, and muted oranges and blues for highlights.
