Create a webpage with a full-width dark blue top header containing a small white input box centered horizontally. Below this, a light gray background section centers a white box with a bold dark gray heading aligned left near the top. Beneath the heading, there's a small blue hyperlink text item on the left. Below this white box, another white box with a thin orange border contains a large bright blue rectangle (image placeholder) centered horizontally. Below the rectangle, left-aligned orange bold text is placed, with a smaller orange subtitle beneath it. At the bottom, have a full-width dark blue footer with small orange navigation links horizontally arranged at the top left, and multiple lines of white text below them aligned left.
