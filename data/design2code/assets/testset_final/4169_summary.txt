The web layout has an olive green background with a header featuring four evenly spaced rectangular images (src 'rick.jpg') aligned horizontally near the top center. To the right of these images, there is a simple, right-aligned navigation menu with three text links in small, light yellow font. Below the header, on the left side, is a vertical navigation menu with brownish-red text links stacked under a large square image (src 'rick.jpg'). Adjacent to this left column is a breadcrumb navigation in small, muted olive text above a title and three paragraphs of body text in dark brown font, arranged in a narrow left column. To the right of the text content, there is a large square image (src 'rick.jpg') aligned horizontally with the text block. At the bottom, a footer contains four centered text groups spaced horizontally in dark brown, each with smaller links underneath in light yellow, and below that a central line of white text with an address and phone details, followed by a copyright line and a privacy practices link in small white font. The fonts throughout are serif for text content, with small sans-serif for footer and navigation menus.
