Create a clean, minimalistic web layout with a main header in large black serif font reading "What Are We Doing?" and a smaller italic subheader underneath in black. Below that, a light beige horizontal navigation bar with grey text includes menu items and dropdown arrows. The main content on the left uses black serif font for the heading and paragraphs in black sans-serif font. On the right, place a light beige box with bold black text for a quote and a blue hyperlink below it. Under the quote box, add two full-width rectangular buttons stacked vertically: the top in muted red with white text and the bottom in green with white text. Finally, include a very dark brown or black footer bar with small muted text inside. Keep the background white overall.
