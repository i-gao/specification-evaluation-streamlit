Create a clean, white-background webpage with a top navigation bar containing a left-aligned search icon and input, and right-aligned "Log in," "Create account," and a cart button with a thin gray border. Below that, center a blue rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg'), with a horizontal menu of four bold black text links spaced evenly beneath it. The main content area features a breadcrumb in small gray text aligned left, a centered bold uppercase heading below, and a large blue rectangular image (src 'rick.jpg') beneath that. Below the image, have black bold and italicized text paragraphs with a line divider above. The footer is gray with four columns of small headings in bold and body text beneath, plus social icons on the right under the last column, and a copyright note at the bottom center in light gray. Use a straightforward sans-serif font, with black text for headings and body, and blue for links or emphasis.
