The web layout features a clean, white background with a dark green horizontal top bar containing two rectangular buttons labeled "Newest ads" and "Sell" in white text. Above it, there is a search bar with a white input field and a green "Search" button, followed by navigation links aligned horizontally: Home, Contact us, Sitemap, and a distinct orange "Login" button. Below the top bar and breadcrumbs in small text, the main content area is divided horizontally: on the left, black text details the boat condition and a vertical stack of nine smaller blue square images (rick.jpg placeholders) each accompanied by green and black text descriptions; in the center, a large blue rectangular image (also rick.jpg) is displayed prominently; on the right, a vertical list of black text boat makes is aligned at the top right corner. The font is a simple, clean sans-serif style, and the page ends with a dark green footer containing centered white copyright text and a small blue square image aligned right. The layout uses boxed content with ample white space for clarity.
