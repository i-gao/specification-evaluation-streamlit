The layout features a white background with a fixed top navigation bar in white including a blue square logo (image from 'rick.jpg') on the left and black text navigation links aligned horizontally on the right. Below, a two-column layout with a narrow left sidebar and a wider main content area on the right. The left sidebar has green vertical text highlights and nested grey text links with indentation, separated by light vertical lines. The main content area uses dark blue headings in a bold sans-serif font with subheaders in a slightly smaller size, black body text, and green highlights for links. Multiple dark blue code blocks with white monospace text are scattered throughout. The overall design is clean, minimal with left alignment and consistent spacing.
