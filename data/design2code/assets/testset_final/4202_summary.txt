Create a centered rectangular content area with an off-white background within a navy blue page background. At the top inside this area, place a wide horizontal image banner spanning nearly the full width, using the source 'rick.jpg' in bright blue color. On the left side below the banner, vertically stack five small square images (also using 'rick.jpg') in bright blue, evenly spaced. To the right of these squares, place text content aligned to the top, formatted with bold headings and regular paragraphs. Use a small, clear sans-serif font in black for the text. Include two thin, bright blue horizontal lines to separate sections of the text content. The layout is clean, with clear separation between images on the left and textual content on the right.
