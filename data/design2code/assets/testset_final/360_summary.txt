Create a clean forum thread layout with a light gray background and a central white content box outlined in a thin gray border. At the top left inside the box, include a breadcrumb navigation in small black font, with each link separated by a greater-than symbol. On the right side of this top bar, place a small rectangular button labeled "PDA" in uppercase, using a gray background and a subtle border. Below, add a bold heading "View Full Version :" in black, with the thread title next to it in bold dark gray. Then, display multiple user posts in stacked, equal-width light gray rectangles with thin borders, each containing the username in bold black on the left and the post date/time right-aligned in smaller gray font. The post content should be in a standard black font below the username line. At the bottom center inside the white box, show a small copyright notice in gray text, aligned horizontally. The font throughout should be a simple sans-serif style consistent with typical forum design.
