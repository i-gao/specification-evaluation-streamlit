Create a webpage with a black fixed top navigation bar containing the brand name "ALPHA" on the left in white uppercase letters and three right-aligned menu items: HOME, ABOUT, CONTACT in white, small uppercase font. Below that, place breadcrumb text in small blue font on a light gray background. Centered beneath this, include a horizontally centered light blue rectangular banner with the company name in green, medium-large sans serif font, and the address (redacted) in smaller black text below it. 

Below that, layout three rectangular content sections horizontally aligned: left and right boxes in bright purple with white, bold uppercase headings ("OVERVIEW" and "BUSINESS INTEL") in a sans serif font, with multiple short informational lines in smaller white text and thin white horizontal separator lines. The middle box is taller, colored in a soft blue background with a slight shadow around it, and contains the heading "CONTACTS" in black, bold uppercase letters. Under each heading, show text blocks using small black font with contact details, center-aligned, and multiple lines.

Under each purple side box is a small horizontally centered light blue button with white text. The background throughout is light gray. Finally, a black footer with small white text is displayed at the bottom centered horizontally. The entire style uses clean, modern sans serif fonts and a balanced symmetrical layout.
